We settled on a process for getting this stuff done:

1. We checked the spreadsheet and picked a task
2. We created a new branch from main
3. We locally changed it to run ruby 3
4. We did whatever was needed to complete that task
5. We pushed it up to CI with ruby 3 change and made sure that passed
6. We then took the ruby 3 change away and pushed it back up to CI to make sure it still passed on ruby 2.7
7. Then we can stick that back into our main branch
8. Then we rebase the ruby 3 branch
9. And update the spreadsheet

This is _boring_ but _mechanical_ -- you just do it. You're just making progress.  And it meant all the work is landing on the main branch which is ruby 2.7 and we're getting there.
