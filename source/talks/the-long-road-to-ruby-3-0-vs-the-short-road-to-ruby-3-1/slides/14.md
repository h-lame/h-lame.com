The problem is, we just kind of fizzled out.  This story takes us to about June / July 2021.  We just sort of fizzled out a bit.  We'd upgraded some germs, we'd fixed some of the `ArgumentError`s, we were making progress but we didn't finish it.  As I said we are start-up, we have finite availability for doing things, and focus on:

* squad goals
* company OKRs
* shipping other interesting things are not going to take us forever to do

Those take priority.

And there was no one really running this, it was a "tragedy of the commons" -- we were _all_ responsible for this so fundamentally _none of us_ were responsible for it.  We were all like "oh we should make some progress on that ruby 3...", but we didn't.  So we kind of just fizzled out on it, and that's a shame.
