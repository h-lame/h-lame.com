We were intentional about making progress.  When we first tried to do this we were like "hey, it'd be nice if we used ruby 3," and that petered out because we didn't have a goal, we didn't know who was doing anything.  Whatever you are doing, if it's not something that lives within a single team try and be intentional about it and get people together.  It won't just happen if people don't show up.  But don't rely on people just showing up randomly for an ad-hoc or nebulous goal.  Give them something they can make progress on.
