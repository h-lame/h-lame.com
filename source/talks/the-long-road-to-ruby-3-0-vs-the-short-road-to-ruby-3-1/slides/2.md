What are we actually going to talk about?

How we upgraded to ruby 3.0

* what we did
* how it went well
* how it went poorly

Then I'll talk about how we upgraded to ruby 3.1

* how it went well
* how it went poorly

Then I will inspire you with some amazing messianic vision of what you should learn from this talk.
