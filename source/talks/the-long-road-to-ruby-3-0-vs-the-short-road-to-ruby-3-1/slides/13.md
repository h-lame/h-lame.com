What we realised by doing this is: all of this work could live on our main branch, because all of this work was still compatible with ruby 2.7.  So instead of inflating this original PR to loads of gem upgrades and loads of API changes, we could land it all on our main branch which meant our original PR got smaller and smaller and smaller.  And also we got fewer and fewer deprecation warnings about ruby 3 on main.  We were able to see progress as we were doing stuff.  And that's enjoyable and helps you ... make progress (I should have written this down).
