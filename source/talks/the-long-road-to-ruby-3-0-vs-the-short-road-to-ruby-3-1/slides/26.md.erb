It's very similar.  A couple of weeks later Murad raised a PR saying "What if we used ruby 3.1.2 now?"<% fnrf 2 %>

It's a very similar story.  There were some gems that meant we couldn't boot the app because ruby 3.1 [removed some stuff from the standard library](https://stdgems.org/new-in/3.1/).  They are now gems and we had to put them into our `gemfile`.  There were a handful of gems that just needed another upgrade.  There were a handful of test failures.  So we did we did the same thing -- we portioned it all out, we got everyone to fix those things, and a couple of days later that was all green.  That had all been landed on main and we were ready to ship this.

So we did!

A couple of days later we just launched another version of ruby.
