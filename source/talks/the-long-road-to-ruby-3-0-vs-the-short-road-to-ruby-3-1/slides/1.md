I am here to talk to you about how we at [Cleo](https://www.meetcleo.com/) upgraded from ruby 2.7 to ruby 3.0.  And that took a long time.  And then how we _very_ quickly then upgraded from ruby 3.0 to 3.1.

I'm Murray. I'm an engineering manager here. I didn't really do any of this work but I couldn't convince any of the engineers who did to be here on a Monday night, which is stupid because they could've got free beer and pizza!
