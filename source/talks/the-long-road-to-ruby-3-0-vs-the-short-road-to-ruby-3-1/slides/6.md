This the story of how we got from April 2021 where Cassie raised the draft PR for ruby 3.0.  Basically "I've done some stuff, ruby 3 doesn't work, how do we get this to a place where it does work?" to May 2022 and our final PR for ruby 3.0 that we merged and deployed and then we were running ruby 3.0.

You don't need to try and read what's on most of the slides but it's just there for some flavour.

There's a hint here as to how we did it: slowly, with lots of people involved.
