Break your big work up into lots of small work that is easy to do.  That's what we did with our ruby 3 upgrade, it's what we did with the ruby 3.1 upgrade as well.  We landed stuff on main as regularly as we could.

If you're working in any form of agile, this is what you're doing.  Someone doesn't come to you and say "build me a hat delivery service!" and you go away for six months and come back with an amazing hat delivery service.  You break it down into lots of tiny shippable things, so that months later you have a hat delivery service.  Even when it's not a product feature, think about how you can break things up into small, achievable, iterable things.
