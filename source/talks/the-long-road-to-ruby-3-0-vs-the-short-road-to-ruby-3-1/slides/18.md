We really liked the idea of the spreadsheet from the first attempt.  Pulling all the information and making it clear that if you hadn't been to a session for a couple weeks you can just come along and ask "What's not got a name against it? What's not got a yes? We could do that this week," which meant it was really easy.

* We pulled some data from the old spreadsheet
* We pulled some data from CI
* We pulled some data with extra information from CI and combination of stuff
* We wrote a little guide in the spreadsheet saying "you should go to CI and you should download this file and _da-da-da-da_

And that was a bit of a nightmare.  So _of course_ once you've written down manual steps someone can automate it...
