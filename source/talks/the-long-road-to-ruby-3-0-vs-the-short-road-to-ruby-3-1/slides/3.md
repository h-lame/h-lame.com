First up, who are we?

We are [Cleo](https://www.meetcleo.com/).  We are building a financial AI assistant that understands your situation and gives you advice and coaching on how to get out of your financial situation.  Because, probably, if you've downloaded one of these it's not great.  We have a fun and punchy tone of voice and visual theme that sets us apart from the rest of the financial advice apps out there.

We are mostly targeted in the USA.  I say mostly, we're _entirely_ targeted in the USA at the moment.  We hope to come back to the UK later but not right now.  We are a start-up.  We have limited ... everything.  So focus is key.

*[AI]: Artificial Intelligence
*[USA]: United States of America
*[UK]: United Kingdom
