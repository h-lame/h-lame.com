So let's go into a bit of detail on Cassie's first PR.  Cassie raised this and already ... it didn't even boot.  We had to comment out some gems that we relied on because they straight up wouldn't easily just work with ruby 3.  We unpinned some gems from our `Gemfile` to say "just get whatever version actually works".

So this PR got us to: the app not booting on ruby 3.  Which is ... good? ... but we couldn't ship it.
