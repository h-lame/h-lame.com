So we put them in a spreadsheet!

Same idea as with the gems; we had a list of things, we put them in the spreadsheet.  You don't need to attempt to read this, but that is the complete list.  There are 59 entries on there so it's not huge.  We have done some aggregation because obviously we have more than 59 tests in our suite and some of them throw out the same problem because of the same call-site being "you're not doing this in the ruby 3 way".

So we follow the same pattern, we have this list, we portion them out and said "hey you fix this one, you fix this one", we slowly started chipping away at it so we could get to a green build.
