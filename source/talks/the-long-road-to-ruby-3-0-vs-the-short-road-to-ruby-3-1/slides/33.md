And last of all, reflect on your mistakes without blame.  We ran a postmortem.  We're very big on no-blame culture because we need to know what went wrong in order for us to learn from it.  When you reflect on what went wrong it has to be blame-free or your people won't tell you what really happened and you will put in mitigations for things that won't matter because that's not what actually happened, it's not the real problem.  When people feel safe to tell you what really happened then you can really learn from it and it really stop it happening again.  If you don't do you'll keeping making the same mistakes.
