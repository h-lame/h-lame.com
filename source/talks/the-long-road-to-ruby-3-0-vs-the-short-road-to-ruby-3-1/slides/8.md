So May 2022.  It was merged two days after it was raised.  All it was, was a bunch of changes in 14 places (but we won't talk about that) to change `2.7.6` to `3.0.4`.  We'd done _all_ of the hard work so that this PR was just changing some numbers.  Then we merged it, and shipped it and it was all good.

How did we get from a PR where the thing didn't even boot to just a tiny set of changes?
