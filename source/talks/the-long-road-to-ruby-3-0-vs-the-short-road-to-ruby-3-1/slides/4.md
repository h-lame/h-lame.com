It is a ruby on rails backend, it's a react-native frontend, a bunch of python doing machine learning in the backend of the backend.  It's backends all the way down I assume.

Some background and context about our app.  I'm going to tell you how we did this upgrade and it's important to know:

* what is our background and context
* what is our app

Because it may be different to your app and everything I'm saying is relevant to us -- it may not be relevant to you.  I think there are some general-purpose understandings that you can take from this, but this is not a one-size-fits-all thing.

We have a ruby on rails monolith.  All our rails app is one app, there are no microservices in the mix in terms of the backend, it's just one giant chunk of rails.

We also have a monorepo.  The frontend react-native code also lives in the same repository.  There is tooling there that is run using ruby, like [`cocoapods`](https://cocoapods.org) and [`fastlane`](https://fastlane.tools), to help build the app and it runs with the same version of ruby.

We are in a multiple team situation.  Depending on the timeframe we have 20 to 30 devs split across 5 to 8 teams.  All working on this one monorepo, on this one monolith, all at the same time.

So that is some context about why we made the decisions of how we would do this stuff to our app.
