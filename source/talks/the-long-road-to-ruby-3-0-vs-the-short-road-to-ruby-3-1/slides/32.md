Treat your small work like big work.  Ruby 3.1 was a really easy upgrade for us.  There was a handful of things to do, so we didn't think it was going to be a problem.  We didn't worry about all the stuff that we worried about for ruby 3, because ruby 3 was _A Big Scary Upgrade_.  Ruby 3.1 _wasn't_ so we just sort of YOLO-ed it and everything went wrong because we hadn't thought about it properly.  So treat your small work like a big work -- go through your checklist to make sure you are _Being Careful_ I guess.
