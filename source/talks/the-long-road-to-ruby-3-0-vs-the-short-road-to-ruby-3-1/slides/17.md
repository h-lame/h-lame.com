So "#ruby-the-third" is the name of our slack channel for getting us to ruby 3.  Our goal is:

> just get it done, let's get onto ruby 3

It's not a requirement for rails 7, but will make it easier.  We were interested in exploring types, but we didn't say "and also we should be using types as part of this" we just need to be running on ruby 3.  That made it feel _achievable_.

We agreed to meet every fortnight and spend an hour.  We decided that it would not be a _talking_ meeting.  We would check in on what we said we had done, but we'd very quickly break out into mobbing, or pairing, or splitting up into breakout groups who would do smaller versions of that.  We would use that time to make progress, explicitly in the editor, on fixing our ruby 3 problem.

And this meant we were able to make constant progress.  Every couple of weeks some PR landed that got us a little bit further towards our goal of shipping ruby 3.
