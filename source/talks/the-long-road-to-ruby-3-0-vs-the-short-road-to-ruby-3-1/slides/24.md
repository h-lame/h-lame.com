And so in May 2022, Ignacio raises a PR that is just number changes.  He put [`co-authored-by`](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/committing-changes-to-your-project/creating-and-editing-commits/creating-a-commit-with-multiple-authors#creating-co-authored-commits-on-the-command-line) the 14 devs that had been involved throughout this whole year long process of doing it.

We _ummed_ and _ahhed_ about it and decided to just merge it.

We merged it.

CI deployed it.

Nothing broke.

This was a job well done by everyone involved!
