Thankfully 2022 rolls around and everyone got a bunch of excitement about "let's make progress on those things we didn't make progress on and be _better_".  Also [ruby 3.1 came out](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2021/12/25/ruby-3-1-0-released/) and we're now one point version behind what is legit.  Rails 7 is saying: "we are going to support ruby 2.7 but rails 8 will come out in a years time and it _won't_<% fnrf 1 %>".  So already, yeah, we need to get onto ruby 3 again.  We got a bit more energised and excited about it but we learned from the past -- if we just say will do it, we won't do it.

So we formed what we call an _action group_!
