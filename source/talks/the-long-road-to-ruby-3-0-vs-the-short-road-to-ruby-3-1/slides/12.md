And most of these are `ArgumentError: wrong number of arguments` because ruby 3 changed how it handles that final hash-style keyboard argument.  In ruby 2.7 if your last argument was a hash it would sort of explode it out and say "these are keyword arguments, yay!".  And in ruby 3 it says "I'm not doing that for you anymore, you're probably trying to pass an actual hash" and we're like "No!  We're relying on the old behaviour!".

So most of the PRs that we raised were doing this -- they were taking a final argument that is a hash and double splatting it to say "it's not hash anymore, it's keyword arguments".  It's very boring work and there's a lot of it.
