Here’s a snippet of code for doing that.  As each line needs the same line padding we can calculate those bytes once at the start using our old friend `pack` (hello `pack`!).  An interesting property of the `pack` method is that if your format string includes `x` it generates a null byte, regardless of the array contents in that position.  This means you can call it on an empty array to get as many null bytes as you want.  So for our `100` byte file, we’d call `[].pack('x2')` to get the string `"\x00\x00"` for `2` null bytes.

Then we extract exactly enough bytes for a full row of pixels from the source file (in our case `18` bytes) using `bytes_from`, a method that returns the bytes we need and an `EOF` flag if we’ve exhausted the file.  Then we write those bytes plus the line padding bytes and loop until the file is exhausted.
