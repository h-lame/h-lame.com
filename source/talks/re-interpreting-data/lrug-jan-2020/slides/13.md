All that’s really interesting is [the `pack` method](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.7.0/Array.html#method-i-pack).  Called on an array of numbers, and passed a format string, pack will convert those integers into bytes according to the format string.  E.g. you can say represent this number as a 4 byte number, or a 4 byte big endian number, or a 2 byte signed integer.

What a WAV file cares about is that some of the header is a 4 byte number, some is a 2 byte number, etc…. That’s what the pack statements here are, `V` for 4 byte big-endian, `v` for 2 byte big-endian.

The format string also takes numbers meaning, repeat the previous character this number of times.  So to get four 4 byte big-endian numbers you can say `VVVV` or `V4`.

And, that’s basically all there is to it.  So lets try it out.
