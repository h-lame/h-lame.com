The data part of a MIDI file is made up of a stream of MIDI Events.  You can think of these like the notes on sheet music.  Each event has three parts:

1. delta time: this tells the MIDI player when to trigger this event.  It’s a variable length value of between `1` and `4` bytes.  It’s the number quarter-note fractions to delay the event by, the exact meaning of which in elapsed time depends on some header settings.
1. status: this tells the MIDI player what this event actually is.  There are events to turn a note on, or turn a note off, or to say how much “aftertouch” to apply to a note, or other esoteric MIDI things.  This is always `1` byte.
1. event data: this provides any extra information that the event needs, based on the status.  For example the “turn this note on” status needs to say which note and how fast.  This part is usually `1` or `2` bytes long, but sometimes `0` if the status has no extra data requirements.

There are lots of different events, but for this library I only care about the “turn this note on” and “turn this note off” events.
