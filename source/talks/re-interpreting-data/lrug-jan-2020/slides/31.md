Our solution is to deal with the *bits* within the source file, not the *bytes*.  We need `27` bits of data from the source file to make one MIDI event:

1. `8` bits can be used to extract the delta time - using variable length encoding of the value this’ll be turned into either `1` or `2` bytes.
1. `1` bit to decide between a “turn this note on” and “turn this note off” status event.
1. `4` bits to say which channel the status event should run on.
1. `7` bits to encode as the key data byte for the status event.
1. `7` bits to encode as the velocity data byte for the state event.

This way we can use all the data from our source file and be sure that it’s going to be arranged correctly for making valid MIDI data.
