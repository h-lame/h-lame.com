So, why ruby though?

We don’t normally do this kind of thing in a language like ruby; byte-level and even bit-level manipulation is pretty unweildy, shouldn’t you use C?

Probably, but ruby is the language I know best, and I was able to get fast feedback by using ruby.  That feels important to me when playing about with these kinds of toys.
