Delta time is stored as [a variable length value](http://www.music.mcgill.ca/~ich/classes/mumt306/StandardMIDIfileformat.html#BM1_1) of between `1` and `4` bytes.  How this is implemented is that a single byte is split into two parts: `7` bits are used to store the value, and the remaining `1` bit is used to say if the next byte contains more data for the value or not.

`0` means no more data, `1` means the next byte contains data.  Values less than `128` can be stored in `1` byte, values more than `128` are stored in multiple bytes.  In theory we could allow for infinitely large values as we can keep setting the “more” bit to `1`, but in practice, the MIDI spec says `4` bytes is the maximum.  This gives us `24` bits to store a value, allowing us to store values from `0` to `16,777,215`.  This should be enough.
