## [London Ruby User Group January 2020](/talks/re-interpreting-data/lrug-jan-2020/)

The first version of this talk.  The theme of the meeting was “A Ruby Talent Show” where we wanted people to show of things that ruby can do other than building websites or doing devops.  I chose to talk about a little project to convert arbitrary files into sound or images.

Given: **[Monday, 13th January, 2020](http://lrug.org/meetings/2020/january/)**
