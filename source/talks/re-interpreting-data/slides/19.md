Next up we have the width and heigh padding.  e.g. making sure we can turn the number of pixels into a rectangular figure.

First we need to work out what kind of rectangle we can make with the pixels we have.  The simplest rectangle is a square, and we can work that out quickly by taking the square root of the pixels we have.  In this case we have `34` pixels which gives us `~5.831`.  We can’t have `0.831`th of a row, so we round that up to get `6`.  This tells us we can create an image that is `6` high by `6` wide, which is `36` (`6²`) pixels in total.

Now we can subtract the number of pixels we have, `34`, from the number of pixels we need, `36`, to find out how many padding pixels we need to give us a square image, in this case `2`.  Of course, that needs to be converted to bytes and for our 24-bit colour depth at `3` bytes per pixel this means `6` more padding bytes for these padding pixels.
