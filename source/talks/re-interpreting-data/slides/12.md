Here’s some ruby code that constructs that header.

The 1st stanza constructs the first part of the WAV header - effectively “I’m a WAV file, and I’m this big, including the size of the header”

The 2nd stanza constructs the second part of the WAV header and includes all the calculated details, you can see all we use is some instance variables (e.g. our choices for what the sample rate and bits per sample will be) and the file size.

The 3rd stanza constructs the start of the data part of the WAV file.

What’s missing is then code to write this to a file, and copy the data from the source file.  You can probably all imagine that, so I’ve elided it.
