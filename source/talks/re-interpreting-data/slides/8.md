Turns out, WAV files are very simple.  They’re made up of a header part, and a data part.  The header part is split in two.

1. The first part tells the world “Hi, I’m a WAV file and I’m this long”.  It’s very short and is there to tell other software “if you don’t know what a WAV file is, you can stop now”
1. The second part tells the audio software how to interpret the data part.  Details in here describe things like: how many channels the sound has (mono, stereo, etc); how many samples there are per second for the sound; how many bits there are per sample.  This basically says how detailed the data is - more channels of audio, more samples per second, and more bits per sample means a better digital representation of the analogue sound wave.

The data part is raw `1`s and `0`s that using the info from the header data, audio software can interpret and output to your speakers.
