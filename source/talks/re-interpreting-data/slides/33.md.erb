As expected we require stegosaurus and get our object for making thingse, this time a `midriffs`, and then pass it the README file.  We can't use quicklook this time around, because macos doesn't have default support for MIDI files.  It's actually a bit of a faff, but there's a program called [`timidity`](http://timidity.sourceforge.net) that you can install via [brew](https://brew.sh) and this'll play the file.  So we pass it to that to [hear what it sounds like](http://assets.h-lame.com/images/talks/re-interpreting-data/output/path-to-stegosaurus-README.mid):

<% audio_figure src: "http://assets.h-lame.com/images/talks/re-interpreting-data/output/path-to-stegosaurus-README.mid.m4a" do %>
  The [stegosaurus](https://github.com/h-lame/stegosaurus) README file, as a MIDI file.  Actually this is a M4A recording of the MIDI played via `timidity` because browsers no longer support direct MIDI playing.  But you can still [click to download the MIDI file](http://assets.h-lame.com/images/talks/re-interpreting-data/output/path-to-stegosaurus-README.mid) if you want it.
<% end %>

So it's longer than the WAV version at 6 seconds rather than almost none.  But this is what you might expect as MIDI is a set of notes to be played so we get more sound with less data.  Let's see what even more data sounds like.
