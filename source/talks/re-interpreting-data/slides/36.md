All the code lives [here](https://github.com/h-lame/stegosaurus).  I chose this name because I thought of this as a simple steganography tool to allow you to could hide data inside other formats.  Except as BMP and MIDI both inject bits and bytes into the source data, you’d need a reconstruction routine and I never wrote that because … well, this was for fun, not something serious.

Or maybe I chose the name because I’m a man-baby who still thinks dinosaurs are cool?

Who could say?
