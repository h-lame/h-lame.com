We used WAV for audio, and there’s [a similarly simple format for images too: BMP (or windows bitmaps)](http://www.ece.ualberta.ca/~elliott/ee552/studentAppNotes/2003_w/misc/bmp_file_format/bmp_file_format.htm).  These are essentially the same kind of thing: a header that describes how to interpret the data as pixels and then the `1`s and `0`s that make up the pixels.  So we should be able to do the same as we did with WAV files to let us see our files instead of hear them.  We calculate the header based on some choices we make (e.g. colour depth expressed as bits per pixel) and then copy the raw data from our source file.

There are some gotchas though that mean we can’t just calculate the header and prepend it directly to our source file and expect it to work:

1. Depending on the coulour-depth we use, we might need to add some bytes to make sure we have complete pixels.
1. Images are rectangular, so we might need to add some pixels to make sure we have enough to make a rectangle.
1. A quirk of the BMP format is that all rows of pixels have to be multiples of 4-bytes, so we might need to pad each row if our colour depth, or image size means a row wouldn’t be a multiple of 4 bytes otherwise.

In all these cases we add pad bytes set to `0x0`.  Now we’ll explore what each of these types of padding really means.
