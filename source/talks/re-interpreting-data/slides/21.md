Ok, so to wrap it up we have chosen 24-bit (`3` byte) colour depth for our image, and we have a `100` byte source file.  This means adding:

1. `2` padding bytes to give us complete pixels
1. `6` padding bytes to give us a square image
1. `12` padding bytes to give us scan lines that are multiples of four bytes

Our `100` byte source file just became `120` bytes of pixel data in our BMP file.

So, how do we add these padding bytes?

Adding the pixel padding is easy, once we’ve used all the data in the source file, we then output the pixel padding bytes to complete the last pixel.  We can do the same for the square padding bytes, once we’ve written the last pixel we can add all the empty pixels we need to complete the square image.  However, the scan line padding bytes are more awkward.

We could just write them all at the end too, but this would mean “wasting” some of the source data bytes as scan line padding bytes, instead of using them as pixel bytes, so we want to interleave the pixel bytes from the source file with the scan line padding bytes.
