Finally, we have to deal with what the BMP specification calls “scan line padding”.

The specification says that each row of pixels in an image is called a “scan line” and each of these must be written in multiples of four bytes.  That is, if we have 8-bit colour depth and a `3` pixel wide image, we need to add a single padding byte to the end of each row.

In our case we have 24-bit colour (`3` bytes) representing `6` pixels in each scan line.  As this is `18` bytes which is not a multiple of four, we need to pad each row to the next multiple of four, which is `20`.  This means adding `2` bytes per scan line, which is `12` more padding bytes.
