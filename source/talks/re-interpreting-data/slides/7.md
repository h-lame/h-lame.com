However…

At some point in my early web-browsing life I came across [a website that described the data structure for WAV files](http://www-mmsp.ece.mcgill.ca/Documents/AudioFormats/WAVE/WAVE.html).

For those who don’t know, WAV files are simple, uncompressed sound files.  The specification explains how to store `1`s and `0`s so they can be interpreted as sound waves.
