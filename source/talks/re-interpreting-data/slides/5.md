Well, if we read the man page a bit more closely we can see that one of the things the `file` command does is open the data file and look at some of it to take a guess as to what the contents of it are.  It doesnâ€™t just take the name of the file on blind faith and say that a file with extension `.pdf` actually contains a PDF.  If the file is really a WAV, the `file` command will tell us so, regardless of the file name because `file` uses the data in the file itself.
