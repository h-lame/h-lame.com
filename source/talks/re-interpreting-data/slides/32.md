Here's the code to do just that.  First we read `27` bytes from the source file and we pad it with zeros if there aren’t `27` bytes available (e.g. at the end of the file).  We read `27` bytes because there's no smaller common factor of `27` (the number of bits we want per event) and `8` (the smallest number of bits we can read at a time).  This means we have `216` bits (`27 × 8`) which gives us enough bits for `8` (`216 ÷ 27`) events.

We turn those bytes into their binary representation and turn this into an array which gives us `216` `1`s and `0`s.  This allows us to loop `8` times to pull out chunks of `27` bits as we outlined above:

1. `8` bits for the delta time,
1. `1` bit for the on / off flag,
1. `4` bits for the MIDI channel,
1. `7` bits for the key,
1. `7` bits for the velocity.

Finally, we write all those bits to our new file with the necessary extra bits around them to make the raw data into valid MIDI delta times, status events and data bytes.  So now we have unsophisticated, but valid, MIDI data generated from arbitrary data.
