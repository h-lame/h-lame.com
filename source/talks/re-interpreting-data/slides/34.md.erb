Once again, we use the currently running ruby interpreter as the input file and this time we get a MIDI file as our reward.  So lets [give it a listen](http://assets.h-lame.com/images/talks/re-interpreting-data/output/path-to-ruby-2.6.5-bin-ruby.mid):

<% audio_figure src: 'http://assets.h-lame.com/images/talks/re-interpreting-data/output/path-to-ruby-2.6.5-bin-ruby.mid.m4a' do %>
  The ruby 2.6.5 interpreter as a MIDI file - (once again this is a M4A version of the MIDI played via `timidity` beceause `&lt;%= browsers %&gt;`, or you can [click to download the MIDI file](http://assets.h-lame.com/images/talks/re-interpreting-data/output/path-to-ruby-2.6.5-bin-ruby.mid) if you want it.
<% end %>

Again, it's longer than the WAV version at just over an hour<% fnrf 4 %>.  Alas it still sounds like a piano being pushed down the stairs, but, I dunno, there's a chaotic charm to it.  Why not leave it on in the background as some *focused coding* music?

I still think there's scope for me to have a late-stage career change and become an esoteric DJ and avant-noise club nights.
