Going back to my youthful attempts to open files without the relevant (usually expensive) software, we can now understand why it didn’t work.  You can call your file whatever you want, and the OS may use that file name to change the icon and tell you what application will open the file, but that isn’t really important.  It’s the `1`s and `0`s inside the file that really matter.  No matter how many times you try, simply renaming a PDF file to a WAV file won’t let you listen to the contents of that PDF file.
