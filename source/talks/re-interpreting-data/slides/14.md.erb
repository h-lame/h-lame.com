So, let’s see what that sounds like shall we?

First we require the library, “stegosaurus”.  Then we get a “waves” obejct from it - we can use this to make WAV files.  Finally we call “make_from” and give it the path to a file.

We’ll use the README file that ships with this repo.  Then in a separate shell we can run quicklook via `qlmanage -p` on the generated file to [hear what it sounds like](http://assets.h-lame.com/images/talks/re-interpreting-data/output/path-to-stegosaurus-README.wav):

<% audio_figure src: "http://assets.h-lame.com/images/talks/re-interpreting-data/output/path-to-stegosaurus-README.wav.m4a" do %>
  The [stegosaurus](https://github.com/h-lame/stegosaurus) README as a WAV file.  Actually it's an M4A version of the WAV to respect your download speeds, but you can [click to download the WAV file](http://assets.h-lame.com/images/talks/re-interpreting-data/output/path-to-stegosaurus-README.wav) if you really want it.
<% end %>

Yes, well, cough and you’ll miss it.  The problem is, even at the lowest settings for how we encode a WAV file, there’s just not a lot of data in our README file to listen to.  Can we try something else?
