On unix systems there’s a command called `file` that when run on a file will do its best to tell you what that file actually is.  For example, if you type `$ file "tax return.pdf"` it’ll reply with something like `tax return.pdf: PDF document, version 1.3`.

This doesn’t seem that useful, because we can tell that `tax return.pdf` is a PDF because of the `.pdf`, can’t we?

Well, not really.  What if we’d renamed `tax return.pdf` to `tax return.wav`?  Well `file` won’t tell us it’s a `RIFF (little-endian) data, WAVE audio` like it would for a real WAV file, it’ll still say `PDF document`.  How?
