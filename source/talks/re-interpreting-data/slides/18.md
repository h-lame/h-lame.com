First up, pixel padding.

One choice we make in the header is how many bits do we use per pixel to describe the colour of that pixel.  A good choice is 24-bits, because it simplifies the file format.  This means we need 8-bits (1 byte) for red, 8-bits (1 byte) for green and 8-bits (1 byte) for blue, giving us 24-bits or 3-bytes per pixel.  The obvious problem here is what happens if our source file size is not a multiple of 3-bytes?

We pad the file, to add `0`, `1` or `2` bytes to make sure we have exactly enough bytes to represent a whole number of pixels.  E.g. a `100` byte file gets `2` bytes added to give us `102` bytes, or `34` pixels.
