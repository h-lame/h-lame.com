In MIDI all status bytes are values greater than 128, and all data bytes are values less than 128.  Meaning we use `1` bit of the byte to tell us if the byte contains a status or some data.

We’re interested in the “turn this note on” and “turn this note off” statuses which are represented as follows:

1. `1000xxxx` for “turn this note on”
1. `1001xxxx` for “turn this note off”

The remaining `4` bits of the status byte contain the channel number for the note.  MIDI allows a track to have up to 16 channels and this part of the status byte is used to say which channel to run the event on.

The value of the status byte tells us how many data bytes we need.  Our note events both take `2` bytes of data; one for the key, and one for the velocity.

The problem here is that it’s very unlikely we’re going to have the raw bytes in our source file arranged in the proper sequence so that all our bytes with values of `128` or more are followed by exactly `2` bytes of values less than `128`.  How can we manipulate the source data to make valid MIDI files?
