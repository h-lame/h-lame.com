Demo time!

As before, we require the library, and this time we get a `bumps` object as this is what makes BMP files.  Then we pass it the `README` file again, and run quicklook on it to [see what it looks like](http://assets.h-lame.com/images/talks/re-interpreting-data/output/path-to-stegosaurus-README.bmp):

<% img_figure src: "http://assets.h-lame.com/images/talks/re-interpreting-data/output/path-to-stegosaurus-README.bmp" do %>
  The [stegosaurus](https://github.com/h-lame/stegosaurus) README file, as a bitmap, albeit scaled up somewhat.  [Click through](http://assets.h-lame.com/images/talks/re-interpreting-data/output/path-to-stegosaurus-README.bmp) for actual size.
<% end %>

Not very interesting is it?  As with the WAV file version of the readme, it's small and not very interesting.  It's just some noise really.  Let's try something more interesting.
