In a WAV file, the data is a digital representation of a sound wave; it’s a recording of a sound turned into `1`s and `0`s using maths.  MIDI however is more like a digital representation of sheet music; it tells a player what instrument to use, what note to play, for how long, how loudly, etc...

Happily [the file specification](http://www.music.mcgill.ca/~ich/classes/mumt306/StandardMIDIfileformat.html) says that MIDI files are not so different to what we’ve already seen with WAV and BMP: there’s a header followed by some data.  Unfortunately the data part has more rules and structure than BMP so we have to manipulate our source bytes even more.
