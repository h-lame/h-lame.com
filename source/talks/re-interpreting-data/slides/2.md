## [RubyConf 2023](/talks/re-interpreting-data/rubyconf-2023/)

The second version of this talk.  While I was proud of the talk I gave at LRUG in January 2020, I always felt there was a better version of it to be done.  I decided to submit it for [RubyConf 2023](https://rubyconf.org) and I was surprised and delighted to be selected.  That gave me the opportunity to work on that better version by expanding on some of the text heavy slides in the original by adding graphics to help explain the concepts, and to provide a slightly more coherent conclusion focussing on encouraging curiosity and fun while coding.
