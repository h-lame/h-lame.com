Here’s a screenshot of some of the files in my downloads folder.

The bit after the `.` in a file name tells the computer what the file is.  For example, a `.ics` is a calendar invite, a `.rtf` is some kind of rich text document, a `.mp4` is a video file, and so on.

Your OS will probably use a handy icon based on the file extension to give you a better hint of kind of thing is in the file, and this icon often indicates which application will open the file if you double click it.
