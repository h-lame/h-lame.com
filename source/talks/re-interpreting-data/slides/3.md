If you rename the file, this’ll change the icon and what application will open it, so your OS will probably warn you.

When I first started using computers, I thought this was all that was involved.  Someone gave me a Word document (`.doc`) and I didn’t have Word at home, so I tried renaming the file to `.txt` or `.rtf` to open it in programs I did have.  Needless to say this didn’t have the desired effect, I couldn’t read the contents of the file.
