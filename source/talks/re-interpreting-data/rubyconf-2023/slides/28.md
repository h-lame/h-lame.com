What if we want _even more_ colours?  We could choose 24-bit colour (AKA: true colour â€“ 16 million colours, your eyes will not be able to cope with that!).  Our 25 byte file is now a glorious 8 and â…“ pixels.  If we donâ€™t have a complete pixel, a BMP renderer is just not going to show the image ðŸ˜ž

Oh, what do we do?
