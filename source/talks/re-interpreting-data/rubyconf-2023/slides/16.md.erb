All that’s really interesting about this code is the [`pack`](https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.2/Array.html#method-i-pack) method. I don’t know about you, but in my day-to-day coding life I’d never encountered it before, so here’s what it does:

Called on an array of numbers, and passed [a format string](https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.2/packed_data_rdoc.html), `pack` will convert those numbers into bytes.  Why’s that interesting?  Aren’t numbers bytes anyway?  Well, as it turns out, there’s lots of different ways to represent a number in bytes and `pack` lets you control that.  So you can say: represent this number as a 4 byte number, or a 2 byte big endian number, or a 2 byte signed integer.  You don’t need to know what those words mean but trust me it’s important when you’re thinking about bytes.

What a WAV file cares about is that some of the header is a 4 byte number, some is a 2 byte number, etc…. That’s what the `pack` statements are doing.  It’s [a `V` for 4 byte little-endian](https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.2/packed_data_rdoc.html#label-32-Bit+Integer+Directives) and it’s [a `v` for 2 byte little-endian](https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.2/packed_data_rdoc.html#label-16-Bit+Integer+Directives)<% fnrf 3 %>.

And, that’s basically all there is to it.
