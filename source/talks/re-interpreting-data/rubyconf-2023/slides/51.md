What’s most interesting here is the top line where we construct the scan line padding.

Our friend `pack` is back, but we’re packing from an empty array?  What’s that going on there?

Well, it turns out, if you want `null` bytes you _can_ create an array of the right number of 0s and `pack` with the appropriate format string depending on how many bytes you want a 0 to take up, or you can use an `x` in your format string.  If you follow that `x` with a number, `pack` will generate that many `null` bytes.  Neither an `x` nor an `x<somenumber>` in your format string will use up any of the numbers in your array.

Here we _only_ want `null` bytes so we call `pack` on an empty array.  We’re getting _something_ from _nothing_, that’s neat!
