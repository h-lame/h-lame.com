Delta time is stored as a variable length value of between 1 and 4 bytes.   It’s a space saving technique.  A piece of music could have, oh I don’t know, as many as 200 notes in it?  If you are always storing 4 bytes for the time that’d be 800 bytes.  Ostentatious!  For most notes you probably don’t need a 4 byte value to say “play this note really soon after the last one”, so if you could store that value in 1 byte numbers, you could save 600 bytes!  That’s useful!

How this is implemented is that a single byte is split into two parts: 7 bits are used to store the value, and the remaining 1 bit is used to say if the next byte contains more data for the value or not.

* 0 means no more data, you’ve got all the information you need
* 1 means read the next byte and find out if you need more

Values less than 128 can be stored in 1 byte, values more than 128 are stored in multiple bytes. In theory this allows for infinitely large values – we can keep setting the “more” bit to 1, but in practice, the MIDI spec says 4 bytes is the maximum. This gives us 28 bits to store a value, allowing us to store values from 0 to 268,435,456. This should be enough for even the longest of long songs.
