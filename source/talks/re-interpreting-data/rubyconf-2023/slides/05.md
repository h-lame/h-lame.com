Going back to my youthful attempts to open files without the relevant (usually expensive) software, this explains why it didn’t work.  You can call your file whatever you want, and the OS may use that for some hints as to what application will open the file, but it’s what’s actually inside the file that really matters.  Renaming a `.doc` to a `.txt` won’t let you get at the words in the doc, renaming a PDF file to a WAV file won’t let you listen to the contents of that PDF file.  I’m wiser now and understand my youthful folly, but…

*[PDF]: Portable Document Format
*[WAV]: Waveform Audio File Format
