I’m opening this in an app called [MIDITrail](https://www.yknk.org/miditrail/en/) that will let me play the MIDI file, but will also show it as a keyboard travelling along a road of notes in space.  Because, why not?

So, let’s listen to the orchestral score of my README:

<% audio_figure src: "http://assets.h-lame.com/images/talks/re-interpreting-data/rubyconf-2023/output/README.mid.m4a" do %>
  The [stegosaurus README](https://github.com/h-lame/stegosaurus/blob/24ec34dff57062ac9edd075163d1c9b8c2c26d08/README), as a MIDI file<% fnrf 16 %>.

That was pretty fun wasn’t it?  Bit short.
