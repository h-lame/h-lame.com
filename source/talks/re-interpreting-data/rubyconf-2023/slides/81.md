To do this we have to deal with the bits within the source file, not the bytes. We need 27 bits of data from the source file to make one MIDI event:

* 8 bits can be used to extract the delta time.  Using VLQ encoding of the value this’ll be turned into either 1 or 2 bytes.  I _could_ use 28 bits as that’s the maximum allowed in a 4-byte VLQ value, but it might also mean pausing for _hours_ between notes and that won’t be fun to listen to.  I could use 7-bits so it always fits into 1 byte, but I didn’t learn about VLQ to not need to use it!  So 8 bits seems like an arbitrary, but good, choice.
* 1 bit to decide between a “turn this note on” and “turn this note off” status event,
* 4 bits to say which channel the note is on,
* 7 bits for which key the note is,
* 7 bits for how hard/fast/soft the note is played/stopped.

This way we can use all the data from our source file and be sure that it’s going to be arranged correctly for making valid MIDI data.
