The header contains two parts:

1. an identifier that says “I’m a MIDI file” and explains some details about what type of MIDI file it is.  Things like things about time signatures, etc…
2. a track header that explains the size of the track data to come.

The track data however isn’t like WAV, we can’t just smoosh the source file under the header and we’re done.

Nor is it like BMP where we have to interpret and interleave some padding.

It’s much more structured and is made up of a stream of MIDI Events.
