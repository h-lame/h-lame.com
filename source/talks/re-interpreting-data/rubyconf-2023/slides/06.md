At some point in my early terminally online life I came across [a website that described the data structure for WAV files](http://soundfile.sapp.org/doc/WaveFormat/).

WAV files, if you don’t know, are simple, uncompressed sound files, storing a digital representation of a recording of an actual sound.  The 1s and 0s of the data are the numerical values that represent that sound wave – hence the name.

*[WAV]: Waveform Audio File Format
