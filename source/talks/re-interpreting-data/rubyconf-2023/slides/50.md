I said the code for WAV for writing the source data was uninteresting, but it’s not for BMP!  Here’s a snippet of it.

We pull bytes from the source file based on how wide the image will be in pixels and we write them to the target file, and then we add the scan line padding bytes.  And we repeat this until we’ve exhausted the source file.

*[WAV]: Waveform Audio File Format
*[BMP]: Bitmap
