How?

Well, a WAV file is header + data.  The data part is easy, we just take the entire contents of the PDF and smoosh it onto the bottom of our WAV file.

The header is more complicated, but not by much.  We can calculate what we need for the first part of the header just by looking at the size of our source file.  By making some choices about the sample rate and bits per sample we can calculate the second half of the header.
