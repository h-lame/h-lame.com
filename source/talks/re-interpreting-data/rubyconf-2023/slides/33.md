Our 3rd problem is scan lines. You could _probably_ have anticipated the first two if you thought about it, but scan lines are a quirk of the BMP format.

A scan line is a single row of pixels from our image.  Our 28 byte file is a 16 pixel image which is 4 by 4 – so it has 4 scan lines containing 4 pixels each.

For _reasons_ the BMP spec says a scan line must be a multiple of 4 bytes

This is fine for our 28 byte file, because our rows are 4 pixels long, each pixel is 3 bytes, and that adds up to 12 which is a multiple of 4.

*[BMP]: Bitmap
