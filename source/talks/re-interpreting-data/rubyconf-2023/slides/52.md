As another aside: there’s a _whole_ lot more that `pack` can do, but **_spoilers_** this was our last outing in this talk.  To learn more I recommend [this post](https://idiosyncratic-ruby.com/4-what-the-pack.html) on Jan Lelis’ [Idiosyncratic Ruby blog](https://idiosyncratic-ruby.com/).  The whole blog is great though and you should go read it all.

I don’t think you’re in the room, but thanks [Jan](https://janlelis.com)!
