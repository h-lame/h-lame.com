The 2nd stanza constructs the first part of the data format details header.  Our arbitrary choices are in some instance variables (e.g. what the sample rate and bits per sample will be) and we combine those with the some calculations on file size to explain how to interpret our data.  There are some magic numbers in here too – but trust me, while they’re important they’re also boring.
