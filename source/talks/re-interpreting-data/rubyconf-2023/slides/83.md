First we read 27 bytes from the source file and we pad it with zeros if there aren’t 27 bytes available (e.g. at the end of the file).

Why 27 _bytes_?  Murray, you said we need 27 _bits_.

Well the problem is file reading APIs are byte-scale not bit-scale.

27 bytes is 216 bits and it turns out there’s no smaller common factor of 27 (the number of bits we want per event) and 8 (the smallest number of bits we can read at a time). So we read 27 bytes and that lets us create 8 midi events using 27 bits at a time.  I told you earlier I didn’t like messing with factoring.
