To encode in VLQ we need two bytes.  The first byte is a 1, followed by six 0s then a 1.  That first 1 says:

> read another byte.

That second byte is eight 0s.  The first 0 of which is the status bit saying:

> the value is complete and you don’t have to read another byte.

So how does this turn back into a value of 128?

*[VLQ]: Variable Length Quantity
