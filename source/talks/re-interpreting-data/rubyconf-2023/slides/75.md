  :image_alt: 'The value 127 is shown in standard encoding using 8 bits: 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 and in VLQ encoding using 8 bits: 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 – the first 0 is highlighted to indicate it is different between the two encodings.  The value 128 is shown in standard encoding using 8 bits: 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 and in VLQ encoding using 16 bits: 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 – the first bit is highlighted to indicate it is status, not data.  The non status bits of the VLQ encoding of 128 are collected together without leading zeros and moved under the bit encoding to show it is the same: 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0; text: 1.

Where have we seen that before?  Oh yeah, the standard bit encoding of 128.

Hurrah!  So that’s Variable Length Quantity encoding.
