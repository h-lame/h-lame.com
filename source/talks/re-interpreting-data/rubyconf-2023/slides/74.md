  :image_alt: 'The value 127 is shown in standard encoding using 8 bits: 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 and in VLQ encoding using 8 bits: 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 – the first 0 is highlighted to indicate it is different between the two encodings.  The value 128 is shown in standard encoding using 8 bits: 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 and in VLQ encoding using 16 bits: 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 – the first bit is highlighted to indicate it is status, not data.

Those leading six 0s are uninteresting to us as well.  And that gives us eight bits, a 1 followed by seven 0s.
