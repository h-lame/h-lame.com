The first is colour depth (e.g. how many colours the image has).  One of the arbitrary choices we make is to choose a colour depth for our image and this has an impact on the amount of data we need.  If we want a monochrome image we choose 1-bit colour depth and each byte of our file is equal to 8 whole pixels.

So a 25 byte file becomes a 200 pixel image.  Nice.
