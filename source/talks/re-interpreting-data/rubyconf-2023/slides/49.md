This completes our scan lines.

Total padding – **19 bytes**.  Yes, this is more than the original source file which is inefficient, but this is an extreme example given the small input file size.  You probably don’t have any 17 byte files on your computer these days – they’re all huge, right?

What’s interesting about this is we can see that pixel + rectangle padding just go onto the end of the source file data, but line padding has to go inside the source file data at the end of each line.  It’s interleaved with the source file data.
