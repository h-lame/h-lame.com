The 3rd stanza constructs the second part of the data format details header which again uses the file size to explain how much data there is.

As we saw, after this header we just have the raw bytes that make up the actual sound data.

What’s missing from this code snippet is how you actually copy the data around between files and write the header to a file.  I’m sure you could all imagine that, so I’m not going to show it.
