Ok.  So.  We can’t rename a file from `tax return.pdf` to `tax return.wav` and expect to be able to listen to it.

But, given how simple the WAV file format is, we _could_ take a PDF file, and put a WAV file header on top of it and _then_ we can listen to it.

*[PDF]: Portable Document Format
*[WAV]: Waveform Audio File Format
