As an aside: you _may_ recognise this kind of encoding if you’ve ever dealt with `UTF-8`.  It’s also a variable length quantity style encoding where a character is stored as 1, 2, 3 or 4 bytes.  Not this _exact_ encoding, but still, those MIDI spec designers were on to something!

*[UTF-8]: Unicode Transformation Format 8-bit
*[MIDI]: Musical Instrument Digital Interface
