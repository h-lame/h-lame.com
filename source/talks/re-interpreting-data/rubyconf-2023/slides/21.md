We explored the WAV file a bit and there’s some structure, that’s _interesting_ right?

I’m not listening to all that white noise to get attuned to the differences though.  What if there was another way to explore the structure of the file?

A visual way maybe?

If we can listen to our files as WAVs, is there a similar shaped file format to let us look at them too?

*[WAV]: Waveform Audio File Format
