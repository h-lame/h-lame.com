However, I kinda think we’ve wasted some of our data.

If we look at it as bytes and pixels you’ll see what I mean.

When I rearranged the pixels into valid scan lines some of those “pixels” aren’t pixels anymore.  They’re not visible – they’re just there to appease the scan line rule.  We can’t _see_ those pixels.

If I apply a “visible” overlay it’ll be clearer.

It annoys me that 6 whole bytes of my file are stuck at the end of scan lines where I can’t see them and they’re not showing me the structure of the file.
