It’s made up of a time and some data:

1. **delta time** – this says when the event should occur.  It’s known as the delta-time because it’s the time since the previous event rather than a fixed “at this point in the song” value.  This can be between 1 and 4 bytes.
2. **Event data** part – this says what the event actually is and can _also_ be broken into two parts.
