“turn this note on” and “turn this note off”

1. `1000xxxx` for “turn this note off”
2. `1001xxxx` for “turn this note on”

The remaining 4 bits of the type byte contain the channel number in which to play this note or stop it.  MIDI has 16 channels to play sound on and a value between 0 and 15 neatly fits into a 4-bit number so that’s convenient.  A channel is kind of like an instrument; it’s not really as simple as that, but for our purposes it can be.
