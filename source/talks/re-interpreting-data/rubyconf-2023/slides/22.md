Yes!  There’s [the BMP image format (Bitmap)](https://paulbourke.net/dataformats/bmp/).  It’s got a header and then pixel data, so we should be able to do basically the same as we did with WAV files: calculate the header and write out our source file as the pixel data.

*[WAV]: Waveform Audio File Format
*[BMP]: Bitmap
