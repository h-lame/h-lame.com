On unix systems there’s a command called `file` that if you give it a file, it will do its best to tell you what that file actually is.

Interestingly, one of the things it does is open the file and look at some of it to take a guess, it doesn’t just take the name of the file on blind faith and say that a `.txt` file is a text file, if it’s actually a zip file.
