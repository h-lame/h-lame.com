We’ve now looked at some BMPs and seen some things, but the thing about that is it was sort of a diversion from my original plan: I wanted to hear files.  While WAVs worked, even the most hardened glitchcore music fan _probably_ wouldn’t enjoy listening to them for less than a second.

Luckily, there’s another file format to play around with…

*[WAVs]: Waveform Audio File Format
*[BMPs]: Bitmap
