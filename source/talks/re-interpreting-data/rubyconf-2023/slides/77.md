MIDI event types are stored in a single byte, but we only have 7 bits to store the type value, because the first bit must be a 1.

There are lots of event types which can be broken into 4 categories:

1. MIDI things I do understand, but don’t care about like lyric or copyright information,
2. MIDI things I don’t understand like ports and resetting,
3. music things I don’t understand like tempo or pitch bending,
4. music things I _do_ understand _and_ care about.
