Here is a screenshot of a fairly standard downloads folder<% fnrf 1 %>.  All these different types of files: pictures, movies, documents, audio.  The file names include the title of the file and after the `.` what’s known as a file extension that tells you what kind of file it is.

In a modern graphical operating system, you don’t have to parse that extension yourself, your OS does it and gives you a handy icon to tell you what the file is, and maybe even give you a hint as to what application will be used to open the file if you double click it.

*[OS]: Operating System
