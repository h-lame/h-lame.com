It does this as a keyboard floating in space travelling along a path of multicoloured rectangles that represent the notes.  The path of notes is full of rectangles and is very long; it trails off into the distance.'

Here we go, it’s quite a lot longer than the README.  Let’s pan around, and see, that’s uh, quite the space road of notes.

I am excited to present to you – _Ruby 3.2.2 the orchestral score_{:.r-tos} – I assume we’ll want this as the soundtrack to some parties later.  Shall we listen to it?

Oh… it’s like an orchestra being kicked down the stairs!  I mean, it’s better than the WAV version, right?  It also goes on for like an hour or so.
