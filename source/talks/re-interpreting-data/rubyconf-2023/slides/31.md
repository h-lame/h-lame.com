It’s not always that simple.  What if it was a 28 byte file?  That gives us 10 pixels.

Yes…

…you _can_ re-arrange that into a 5x2 rectangle.

Buuut.  Factoring huge file sizes to find convenient rectangles, that will also be reasonable to look at on a screen might be painful.  We don’t want wide and short or tall and skinny images.  Simplest thing _is_ just to work with squares.
