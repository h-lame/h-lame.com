All the code lives here if you want to play with it.  It won’t hold up to a critical reading, and every time I come back to it I find some more bugs (and put more in apparently).

I said earlier I chose this name because I thought of it might be a steganography tool to allow you to hide data inside other formats.  But it’s not because I wasn’t interested in writing the reconstruction routines that BMP and MIDI would require because… well, this was for fun and that didn’t interest me.

*[BMP]: Bitmap
*[MIDI]: Musical Instrument Digital Interface
