So it is `null` to the rescue again.  Hurrah!

We have a simple “algorithm” for calculating the smallest square that can contain all our pixels.

1. Get the number of pixels – **10**
2. Take the square root – **3._something_**
3. Round that up – **4**
4. Square it – **16**
5. Subtract the number of pixels you have – **16 minus 10** = **6**

Now we know how many padding pixels to stick onto the bottom of our image to make a square.

It might be inefficient in terms of extra bytes, but it is simple as it only uses two or three methods from [`Math`](https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.2/Math.html).
