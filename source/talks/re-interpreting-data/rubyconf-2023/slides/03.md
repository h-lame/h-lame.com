Indeed, if you rename the file to change the extension, this will very likely change the icon and the application that will open it.  Your OS might even warn you about that.

When I first started using computers, I thought this was all that was involved: rename the file and you’ll be able to use it.  Of course it’s not.  When I tried renaming a file from `.doc` to `.txt` (because I didn’t have Microsoft Word at the time) I couldn’t open the file to read it in notepad – it was just a stream of nonsense.

I did try the example in the screenshot – I hoped that if I renamed a PDF to a WAV it would magically be able to read all the words in the PDF out to me.  Obviously, it didn’t, it just gave me an error.

So there’s more to it than just the file extension; what’s going on?
