MIDI!

MIDI stands for Musical Instrument Digital Interface and the file format is part of a standard for communicating with actual hardware instruments like synthesisers and such like.  The part that’s interesting to me is that as a file format instead of storing the actual recorded sound data like WAV, it’s more akin to sheet music, and, as a format it’s header + data based so we can work our magic with it, too.
