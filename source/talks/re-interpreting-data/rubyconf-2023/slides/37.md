I gave myself a self-imposed rule: I didn’t want to waste any source file bytes.  It’s my project, and I can do what I want, even if it creates problems to solve.  Which, I guess, that’s why we’re all here: to solve problems with programming even if they’re self-imposed and silly.  I want to use as much data from my file as possible to make my image so we’re going to have to rethink.
