MIDI event data is also stored in a single byte, and we also only have 7 bits to store the  value, because the first bit must be a 0.

Yes!  This means we can easily tell the difference between a type byte and a data byte.  This is probably useful for reading files and bailing immediately on corrupt data.

Our note events both take 2 bytes of data; one for the key, and one for the velocity.

Key is literally which note to play.  For example middle C, a popular note I believe, is note number 60 (not quite the middle between 0 and 127, but whatever music nerds).

Velocity is how hard the note is played.  Sometimes known as attack.  Think of it like a numerical value for how soft or hard you press the key on a piano, or took your hands off the key on the piano.

Other events take different data that mean different things, but all stored in one or two bytes.
