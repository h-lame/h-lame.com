Pretty easy – unlike almost any other programming problem, it’s `null` to the rescue!  We just add `null` bytes to the end of the data!

We can work out how many whole pixels the data would create and how many padding bytes we need to complete the last pixel – it’s a function of file size and colour depth.

Problem solved!
