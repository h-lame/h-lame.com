If we put it all together, what do we need to store one of our note on or off MIDI events?

We need:

* a delta time,
* a type (on or off),
* a key,
* a velocity.

That looks like this:

* a byte that starts `0`,
* a byte that starts `1` `0` `0`,
* and then two bytes that start `0`.

Or… because delta time can be two bytes it could be a `1` byte, a `0` byte, a `1` `0` `0` byte and two `0` bytes.

Or… three.

Or… four.

There is no five because delta time is 1 to 4 bytes.

Hopefully you can see the problem we have to solve.  It’s _verrrrry_ unlikely that our source file is going to have its bytes arranged so that the first bits magically adhere to this structure.

Our solution is to use our source data to fill in the orange parts of these diagrams, and statically fill in the blue parts.
