But, more existentially, why have I made this actual thing?  It is, let’s face it, a pointless little toy, and why have I eaten 44 minutes of your life telling you about it?

I made it because I was curious and I thought it would be fun.  We don’t often get to combine those two traits at work and that’s what I want to encourage by sharing my story.

Day-to-day coding at work can be… boring?  Same-y?  A friend boiled a lot of what we do down to:

> putting strings in a database and taking them out again<% fnrf 18 %>.

I’m not saying work can’t be exciting, or challenging, or mentally stimulating – it often is!  But an important part of a project like this for me is the freedom and fun of it all.  I’m not making tradeoffs about user value and tech debt.  I’m not following a road map or worrying about best practices.  I’m just exploring something that’s interesting to me and making choices of what to build based on the whim of it.

Maybe you’re lucky and the itches you want to scratch are _exactly_ the ones you get to scratch at work every day, but programming computers is _amazing_ – we can make them do anything with just a few lines of letters, numbers, and too much punctuation.  I refuse to believe that you have nothing outside the limited scope of your job you’d want to make a computer do!  I encourage you to embrace that and go explore some idea that’s fun to you.

I’m categorically not saying you have to _“hAvE a PaSsIoN fOr CoDiNg”_ and fill your evenings and weekends with extra coding.  You can do this in your 9-5 – think about how you could embrace curiosity and fun in your day-to-day work.  What are the opportunities to follow your whims?  Look for those, or make the opportunities yourself.  I shared [the rubocop-magic_numbers gem](https://github.com/meetcleo/rubocop-magic_numbers), not _just_ to shoe-horn a work reference in to justify them paying for the trip (thank you Cleo!) but because it was built by a colleague who wanted to play with [rubocop’s AST](https://docs.rubocop.org/rubocop-ast/) stuff and managed to fit that into their day-to-day work in way that would be useful to the rest of us.

So, maybe you’ll learn something useful for work;

* I learned about space saving encoding techniques, and bit and byte manipulation, which could come in handy if I ever do embedded systems work.

Maybe your side-projects can spin out into a livelihood;

* I will happily come DJ at your wedding with a custom orchestral score generated from your personal data files

Maybe your side-projects will even be useful at work;

* like a new rubocop gem to encourage best practices

But, those shouldn’t be the only reason to do something.

This isn’t about _work_, it’s about _play_.
