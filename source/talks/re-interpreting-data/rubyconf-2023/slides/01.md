Hi,

I’m Murray, thanks for coming to my talk.  I’m an Engineering Manager at [Cleo](https://meetcleo.com/).  We’re based in the UK but our customers are in the US.  We’re empowering people to build a life beyond a paycheck and we do that with an AI assistant that understands your banking information in order to give you personalised and relevant advice on your personal finances, and, for a fee, access to a range of services to actively help you improve your situation.

Buuut… I’m not talking about anything related to that, so if it sounds interesting, we _are_ hiring and we can help with visas and relocation so, come and find me later.  I have this face.  You’ll find me.

What I am here to talk to you about is files and data and… well, let’s just get started.

*[US]: United States (of America)
