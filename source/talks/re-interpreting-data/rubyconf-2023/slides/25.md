  :image_alt: 'A box representing a BMP file called "selfie.bmp". It has been split into two – the header part at the top, and the pixel data part at the bottom.  The header part has been split into three: the BMP Identifier & length at the top, the Image size & format details in the middle, the Colour table at the bottom. text: selfie.bmp; BMP Identifier & length; Image size & format details; Colour table; Pixel Data part'

1. An opening segment with the BMP identifier and the length of the file
2. A second segment with information about the image: width, height, colour depth, DPI resolution (e.g. if you want to print the bitmap out this scales pixels to inches), etc…
3. A final segment that describes the colours used in the image. BMP is an indexed colour format; the pixels are not red, green, blue values they’re a number that points to an entry in the colour table.

It’s nothing we’ve not done before with WAV files.  Except the pixel data part is a little more complex.  We can’t just throw all the data at the end of the header and expect it to work.  There’s 3 problems we have to solve.

*[DPI]: Dots Per Inch
*[WAV]: Waveform Audio File Format
*[BMP]: Bitmap
