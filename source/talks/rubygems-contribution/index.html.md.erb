  <% fndf 1 do %>It seems I also changed the `>=` operator into the `~>` operator, so a two character change.  I hope you will forgive the error.<% end %>

  <% fndf 2 do %>Itʼs not possible in the github UI to convert an issue into a PR, but it was possible via the API and I used the command line tool [hub][] to do so.  Itʼs since [been deprecated though][hub-issue-to-pr-deprecation].  These days youʼd create an issue and then reference it in your PR.<% end %>

  <% fndf 3 do %>I guess I mean reading.<% end %>

I gave this talk at the [October 2016 meeting of the London Ruby User Group](http://lrug.org/meetings/2016/october/).

The transcript comes from my presenter notes, so itʼs not a direct transcript of what I said on the night, but pretty close.  Consider this the authorʼs preferred text.
