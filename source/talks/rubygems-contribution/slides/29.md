Many open source maintainers are volunteers and we canʼt expect them to jump to it whenever we drop some new work in their lap.

Of course it can be frustrating to not get a response, but itʼs almost certainly not because the maintainers are ignoring you.  Chances are theyʼre doing this in their spare time, and if their day job is a full-time developer itʼs not surprising when they donʼt want to come home and spend the rest of the day doing the exact same thing as they do at work.
