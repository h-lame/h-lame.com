In summary, when contributing to open source:

1. Raise an issue first to find out if the maintainers agree that what you want to do is something they’ll accept.  If they donʼt agree youʼve not wasted any time on the hard part of actually fixing it.
1. Donʼt assume your issue will be accepted and worked on or your PR will be merged.  Expect that it won’t be and come up with workarounds in any project that relies on the fix.
1. Donʼt hassle the maintainers for an update.  Theyʼll get round to your issue at some point, and if they donʼt maybe they changed their mind about how appropriate the change is.  That’s their prerogative.
