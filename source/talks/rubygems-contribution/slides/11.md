So what changed?

First I found the code that raises the error in the rubygems source to check if it was raising as it should (it was).  Then I read more of the surrounding code and the project documentation to see if there was a different way to express my dependencies (there wasnʼt).  Finally I did some code-archaeology to find out when that part of rubygems had changed and see if I could work out why.

I found out that [Rubygems 2.2](http://blog.rubygems.org/2013/12/26/2.2.0-released.html) introduced the error I was seeing, and weʼd last released the gem using an older version which explained why it worked before.  This version of rubygems would [refuse to build a gem if the gemspec listed a dependency twice](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/commit/03dbac93a3396a80db258d9bc63500333c25bd2f), I think as a way to get maintainers to tidy up their gemspecs.

I didn’t have the full context on why they’d made the change but it seemed reasonable, what didn’t seem reasonable was not taking the type of the dependency (runtime vs. development) into account.  Surely lots of gems that provide tools for testing would have similar dependency schemes to mine, so I [filed a bug](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/pull/1032).
