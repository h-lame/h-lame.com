First up: reporting an issue.

When I found the issue, I immediately assumed rubygems was broken because I am perfect.  However, before raising an issue accusing them of being idiots I took some time to investigate to find out where the fault really was.  Iʼd have looked pretty foolish if the maintainers pointed out I hadnʼt even read the docs where it clearly says you canʼt do this.
