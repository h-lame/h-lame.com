Itʼs on one of these breaks way back in September 2014 where my story begins:

Iʼd already tidied up my laptop and dev tools was looking for something else to do.

We have [a gem called “`be_valid_asset`”](https://github.com/unboxed/be_valid_asset) which provides rspec matchers that check if your HTML, CSS, or feeds are valid according to [the w3c specifications](http://validator.w3.org).  The gem provides these matchers to work with any version of rspec, but itʼs own specs are written in rspec 2.

I decided to upgrade those specs to use rspec 3 and at the same time convert them from the old `should` syntax to [the new `expect` syntax](http://rspec.info/blog/2012/06/rspecs-new-expectation-syntax/).
