Second: workarounds.

Most of my open-source contributions come from finding something that can be improved about a tool I’m using, while I’m trying to use it to do something else.  It’s a bad place to be if your client work can’t continue because it relies on a bug being fixed in upstream code.  Even if the maintainers agree that the issue is a bug, thereʼs no guarantee theyʼd give it any kind of priority that aligns to when I want it done.  Their roadmap is certainly not my roadmap.

Knowing this was a possibility I came up with a workaround for `be_valid_asset` that let me actually release it.
