By doing some research I was fairly sure that the error I’d encountered was caused by a real bug.  I included all these details in the issue I raised.  It’s a far from perfect bug report, but it had plenty of detail in it so the maintainers could understand what I was trying to do, the problem I encountered, and what I thought the solution might be.
