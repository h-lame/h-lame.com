The source for [`be_valid_asset`](https://github.com/unboxed/be_valid_asset) uses [bundler](https://bundler.io) so I was able to move the development dependency out of the [gemspec](http://guides.rubygems.org/specification-reference/) and into the [Gemfile](http://bundler.io/man/gemfile.5.html).  Rubygems only looks at the gemspec when building the gem so this avoids the issue entirely.  It’s annoying that rubygems doesn’t know about the development dependency on rspec 3, but anyone coming to the code will soon find it in the Gemfile.

I [committed this change](https://github.com/unboxed/be_valid_asset/commit/70e846a59a1fd7c5e7990c0d08e0b39b2ae980cd) and included a note about what I’d found along with a link to the issue I’d raised so I could come back to it later.

Workaround done, I was able to release the gem.
