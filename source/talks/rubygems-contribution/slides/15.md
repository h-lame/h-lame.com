[Eric replied](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/pull/1032#issuecomment-57837553) thanking me for the code, said not to worry about the other issue, and said he ºd merge it when he had some time.

Another Rubygems maintainer, Daniel Berger, [merged the PR](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/pull/1032#event-393355907), and [added a note to the changlog](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/commit/ae1718fd2d0e238940c38d56e32c56bffe083894) about it.
