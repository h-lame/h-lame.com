In between client projects I like to take a few days to decompress.  Obviously this can mean going on holiday and eating gelato in an [Italian Piazza](https://goo.gl/maps/ws7oSu3y8yH2), but what I really mean is finding something to do at work that’s less taxing than client projects.  I do things like upgrade the OS on my laptop or investigate new dev tools Iʼve read about but not had a chance to play with yet.

I also look at our internal projects and open-source tools to see if there’s anything I can do to improve them.  This usually means doing maintenance upgrades; you know: bump a dependency version here, resolve a deprecation warning there, upgrade to new APIs … everywhere.

This is the perfect kind of work to do for these breaks.  You get to learn about changes to familiar dependencies in a low-risk environment, and you donʼt usually have to think too much; test failures, runtime error messages, and upgrade documentation (when it exists) guide you through the whole process.
