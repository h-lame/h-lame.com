Releasing a new version of `be_valid_asset` wasn’t very important, but imagine this was production code that you need to release quickly.  A few days delay could be a real problem, and months almost certainly would be!

Itʼs worth saying that I didnʼt commit my workaround a week or a month into this process. I did it straight after reporting the issue.

It took over a year from reporting the issue to there being a released version of the software that solves it.  Because I worked around it though, I didnʼt really care.  I just got a nice surprise the next year when a colleague mentioned my name was in the release notes for the new rubygems.
