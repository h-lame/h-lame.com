This is an really easy process because of the excellent [transpec tool by Yuji Nakayama](http://yujinakayama.me/transpec/).  The first time I did a rspec 2 and `should` to rspec 3 and `expect` upgrade I did it by hand because I didnʼt know about transpec.  It took ages and I almost gave up.  The next time?  I used transpec and it was a breeze.

Transpec is amazing and you should use it.

So, after running transpec and tidying up a couple of other things to make sure that the matchers still worked with earlier versions of rspec even though we now tested them with rspec 3, I was ready to release the gem.  I bumped the version number and [ran the `gem build` command](http://guides.rubygems.org/command-reference/#gem-build) to produce the new version.
