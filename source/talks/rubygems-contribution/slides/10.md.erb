This is where my problems began; rubygems wouldn’t build our gem and spat out this error message.

Our gemspec said that you could use the gem with any version of rspec (the runtime dependency), but if you wanted to develop the gem you needed rspec 3 or greater (the development dependency).

The error tells me that I canʼt specify rspec twice and should combine the separate runtime and development dependencies into one runtime dependency ultimately saying you needed rspec 3 or greater, which isnʼt what we wanted - the matchers can be used with earlier versions of rspec.  This seemed odd to me as I only changed a single character in the gemspec; [swapping a 2 for a 3 in the development dependency for rspec](https://github.com/unboxed/be_valid_asset/commit/406b912d9c93022da652080ce1f3ab108fa5fb62#diff-099ff9702178da1533c1649a2b82e29d) <% fnrf 1 %>.
