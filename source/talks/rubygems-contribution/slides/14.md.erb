Back to the issue.

A rubygems maintainer, Eric Hodel, [commented on the issue](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/pull/1032#issuecomment-57423713) to confirm that what Iʼd found was a bug, and that my suggested fix sounded correct.

I worked on it a bit until I had [some code to push up](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/pull/1032#commits-pushed-f4f611f), and turned the issue into a PR with that code attached<% fnrf 2 %>.

I had a couple of questions about my approach, particularly around going a little bit further with my solution so I [asked these in a comment](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/pull/1032#issuecomment-57825383) at the same time.
