I didnʼt jump straight to coding because even with my research I had no idea if what Iʼd suggested was actually how they’d want to fix it.  It could be that the fix isnʼt the code solution Iʼd offered, but a change to the documentation that makes it clear you canʼt have duplicate runtime and development dependencies (even if you might want to).
