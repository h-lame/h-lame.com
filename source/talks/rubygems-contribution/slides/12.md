I described the error I saw, what I expected to see, and gave an outline of what I thought the solution might be.

Even though I’d done some research and raised an issue I wasnʼt too sure if what Iʼd found was really a bug.  I really wanted to release our gem and get it off my todo-list, so I looked for a workaround.
