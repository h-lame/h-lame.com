Which brings me finally to communicating with the maintainers.

What I showed in my story is all of the communication between me and the maintainers on this issue.  I could have prompted them every so-often for an update, but I donʼt think that would been helpful to anyone.

Iʼm sure that at work weʼve all been in a situation where a client or colleague is continually asking you if something is done yet, and each time they ask you have to tell them itʼs not.  These questions never help you get it done faster, and I doubt you enjoyed it.  And yet this is exactly what weʼre doing to open-source maintainers when we leave “+1”, “me too”, or “is this project dead?” comments on issues.
