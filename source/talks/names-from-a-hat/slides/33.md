These are the basic building blocks.  There’s lots more to explore but this is enough for now I think.  It’s the ruby you know and love, driving a simple, but powerful UI kit and well worth exploring.

If you want to find out more later, just search for [shoesrb](http://shoesrb.com) - you can’t really search for just “shoes” or even  “ruby shoes" as you’re just going to get loads of _actual_ “shoe on your foot” type content.
