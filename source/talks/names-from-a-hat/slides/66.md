I liked the spectacle of the hat, but I felt that up to now everything was really just a fancy version of the initial `Array` implementation from the start of the presentation: put a list of names in and call `Array#sample` or `Array#shuffle` to get a list of names out.

I _really_ wanted to make something truly interactive and where it felt like I was more a part of the randomisation process.  At best, in the previous versions I was controlling a timing element of _when_ to call `Array#sample` to get a random name out.

The hat with it's main loop and button-pressing state changes reminded me of what little I knew of game programming.  You create a world, you take some input, you update the state of the world, render it, then loop.

So I created a “game” called “El Rogue! And the Speakers of Lightning” - let’s watch it in action while I talk:
