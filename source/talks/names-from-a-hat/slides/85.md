As another little aside, turns out, although there is plenty of non-ruby terminal roguelike content out there, I’m not the only person to fiddle about with ruby for this kind of thing.  A couple of months ago [Dmitry Tsepelev](https://dmitrytsepelev.dev/) published this [lovely blog post taking you through the steps to build your own ruby-based dungeon crawler in the terminal](https://dmitrytsepelev.dev/terminal-game).  It has monsters and is way more game-like.  You should definitely read this if you’re thinking of doing this yourself.
