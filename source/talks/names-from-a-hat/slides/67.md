  :image_alt: "This video shows a playthrough of El Rogue and the Speakers of Lightning.  The `@` symbol that representes El Rogue moves through the terminal window revealing a rooms + corridor style dungeon.  As El Rogue moves through the rooms it discovers `￥` symbols which when walked over reveal the name of the next speaker and their talk, using more ASCII art fonts."

I didn't think I could whip up a decent game in shoes, or anything else remotely graphically complex, but I did think I could do something in the terminal.  Ruby is great at string manipulation, and with a big enough terminal window, you get plenty of screen real-estate to render a world in.

There’s [a terminal game called rogue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogue_(video_game)), where you play as a little `@` symbol, traversing a dungeon as delimited by hyphens, pipes, underscores etc to make the walls.  You find other characters as monsters to fight or treasure to collect. Randomness comes in in that the whole dungeon is randomly generated each time you play, as is the positioning of the monsters and treasure.  Finally, the player themselves wanders the dungeon on their own desire, choosing which monsters to fight, in which order.

This sounded like a perfect combination of computer and human randomisation.  I didn't know how to do it, but it’s just string manipulation and emboldened by my success with conquering animation with the hat version, I figured, how hard can it be?
