Anyway, I wouldn't say I've used fibers in production.  I know that deep in the stack of my rails app there are fibers being used somewhere, but _I_ didn't write that code.  Having explored fibers a bit though, I do have some residual knowledge lurking there in my memory, ready to leap out and be useful at some point.  For example if I have to spelunk deep into the libraries we use and encounter fiber code, or if I have to debate the merits of the [puma app server](https://puma.io) (which is thread-based) vs the [falcon app server](https://socketry.github.io/falcon/) (which is fibre-based).

So, my plea to you, go explore some technology you’re not using and have no real need to use ... _yet_.  Use it to solve some problem it’s _wildly_ inappropriate for, you’ll get exposure to it and be that bit more familiar when you encounter a problem it _is_ appropriate for.  You don’t want shipping to production a new mission critical change to your app to be the first time you’ve ever used that new tech.
