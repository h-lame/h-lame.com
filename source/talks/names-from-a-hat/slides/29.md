There’s no `initialize` method so if you need some internal state, you just set that up in the block.  Here I’m using [`ask_open_file`](http://shoesrb.com/manual/Built-in.html#ask_open_file) to prompt the user for a file to read the list of names from, and then I'm setting some instance variables for use later.
