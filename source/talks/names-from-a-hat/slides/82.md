Then rooms are placed in the worlds, and finally the rooms are connected by corridors.  The video shows this process several times with different results each time."

The next thing I want to talk about is how we generate the dungeons.  The code is fairly complex and spread across multiple files, but luckily I could easily tweak the engine to render the world and each step in the dungeon generation process to illustrate it (because of how excellent my design was for the rendering via `TileSet`s).

So we take our world - here delimited in green - the full screen size of our terminal window minus a row for instructions.

Then we randomly split it (random choice of horizontal vs vertical and random choice of position, favouring the middle over the edges).  This gives us two child worlds inside the original world.  We then keep doing this with each nested world we’ve created until we have at least our desired number of leaf worlds.  There’s also a random chance that if we ask a world to split, it won’t.

Then we ask each world to place a room somewhere in the space, randomising position and width and height.

Then we link the rooms by drawing corridors to connect them walking up from the leaf nodes to their siblings and then their parents.

And that’s one way to randomly generate a dungeon
