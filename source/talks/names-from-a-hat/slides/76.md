El Rogue moves around so we’re constantly having to tell the `Tile`s where it is.  We do that in a method on `TileSet` that tells all the tiles that El Rogue is _not_ here, then tells the one that represents El Rogue’s current `x` and `y` co-ordinates that El Rogue _is_ here.

It’s probably not very efficient, but ruby is fast enough to process all this between keypresses for a terminal game.
