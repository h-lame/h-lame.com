So this is what I came up with:

This app shows a list of potential speaker names.  When you press the button it cycles through the names to highlight the one that might be chosen.  When you press the button again, it picks one and shows it big.  Then you repeat this process until all the names have been chosen, and your final button press shows a list of all the names in the order you chose them.  Quite the step up from strings in the terminal.  Success!

Now, obviously, you could do this kind of UI in the web.  The difference is that we have to think in two languages to do it, ruby for the backend on the server, and javascript on the client.  With shoes, it's _all_ ruby.  That's what's fun about this version for me.

The whole app code isn’t huge, but more than I can squeeze on a single slide so I’ll show you some of the interesting parts.
