There are great resources out there for learning these techniques.  There’s [a whole wiki dedicated to rouge building](https://roguebasin.com).  I just picked the first technique that I could get my head around, e.g. [the one with pictures to help me understand it](https://roguebasin.com/index.php/Basic_BSP_Dungeon_generation).

And when I first [built it](https://github.com/h-lame/lruggery/blob/4e02855d64a111c8ee72e1a736da7a868384a1f8/names_from_a_hat/rogue/lib/rogue/generator.rb) and got it working I spent ages running the algorithm and tweaking the params to see how they changed the dungeons it generated.  I could spend forever just watching it do this.

But there are so many more techniques for creating dungeons, and even different types of dungeons.  I’ve chosen a rooms + corridors dungeon using [a random subdivision generation model](https://roguebasin.com/index.php/Basic_BSP_Dungeon_generation).  You could use [a uniform grid](https://roguebasin.com/index.php/Grid_Based_Dungeon_Generator), or a [random walk + place algorithm](https://roguebasin.com/index.php/Dungeon-Building_Algorithm).  You could create more cave like dungeons that you [hollow out of the terminal window using cellular automata](https://roguebasin.com/index.php/Cellular_Automata_Method_for_Generating_Random_Cave-Like_Levels), or [maze generation](https://roguebasin.com/index.php/Maze_Generation) algorithms.  Or you can combine different techniques.

What I learned is that just like there are 1,000,000 blog posts on how to structure your rails business logic, there are 1,000,000 articles giving you help on loads of game programming techniques.  Our community isn’t unique in how much it shares.
