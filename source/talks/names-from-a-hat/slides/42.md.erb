The next way I over-engineered the problem was another shoes application, but this time I wanted more ... pizazz on the screen<% fnrf 8 %>.  This time I needed to pick the winners of a bunch of prize draws we were doing for some books so I wanted to drum up some anticipation of the draw which weâ€™d be doing live on the night of the meeting.

In the one we just saw, the flickering names brought an element of tension: "oh it's highlighted my name, will it be me", but this time I really wanted to be true to the original ideal - drawing names from a hat.
