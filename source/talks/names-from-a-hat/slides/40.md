Well, it’s part of the `pick_a_winner` method called in the `animate` loop.  In this method we have our old friend `Array#sample` to pick a name from the list of volunteers and store it in `the_luckiest` variable, as well as updating the names to style them differently if they are the current chosen name or not.

All the things I want to happen are happening, but it’s not really done in the way you’d want it to for sustainable future development.  That’s fine, this is a one off program for a meetup, and I doubt anyone had seen this code until I shared it with you just now.
