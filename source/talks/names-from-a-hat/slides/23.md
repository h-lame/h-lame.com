Now. _Obviously_ you don't need fibers to do this.  This is over-engineering for sure.  I mean, I’m even using the wrong `Array` method — [`shuffle`](https://ruby-doc.org/3.3.6/Array.html#method-i-shuffle) is the one that I should use for a running order from an array, but I’m using [`sample`](https://ruby-doc.org/3.3.6/Array.html#method-i-sample) to get individual elements!!

Not gonna lie though I enjoyed the _frisson_ of danger that comes from writing an infinite loop.  You don't get to do that _often_ in production code do you?

That’s one, I think, of the fun things about fibers, you can, kinda, almost, throw away your ideas about termination and loops.
