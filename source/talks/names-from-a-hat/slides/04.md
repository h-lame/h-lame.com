A ruby floats up from the bottom of the image to the middle, then a rainbow cloud with the text 'Array#shuffle' floats up, settling to the left of the ruby, followed by a rainbow cloud with the text 'Array#sample' which floating up and settles to the right of the ruby; text: Array#shuffle; Array#sample"

Well, I am delighted to tell you that ruby is the perfect tool for the job:

* [`Array#shuffle`](https://ruby-doc.org/3.3.6/Array.html#method-i-shuffle) will return your array in a new, randomised order (perfect for tournaments and running orders!)

* [`Array#sample`](https://ruby-doc.org/3.3.6/Array.html#method-i-sample) will pick a random element from the array (perfect for prize winners)

Everything we need is right there — they talk about python as being “batteries included”, but I think Ruby is really doing great here.
