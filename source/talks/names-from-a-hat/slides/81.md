Finding the surrounding tiles is iterating over every tile and [USING SOME PYTHAGORAS](https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/articles/zhws46f) on their co-ordinates to find those that are within the radius of the circle created by the strength of El Rogueâ€™s eyes.

Again, not very efficient to do every tile every time, but again, ruby is fast enough.
