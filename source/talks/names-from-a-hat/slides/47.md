If you’ve done any programming with [processing](https://processing.org) or [nodebox](https://www.nodebox.net) or [HTML canvas](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/canvas) or even [SVG](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG) this might be familiar to you, so you can learn about this style of programming by searching for those things.

It really is quite fun, and I’d encourage you to explore how to [create interactive art](http://shoesrb.com/manual/Art.html) using these techniques.
