There’s a lot of code to wrap around that little `Array#sample` call, so definitely over-engineered.  But why I think this was useful is that it exposed me to GUI programming and helped me to understand writing code in a different paradigm.

Mixing state and behaviour is the problem with the code I showed you, and while that's not unique to UI code, I do think it's a lot easier a mistake to make with UI code.  Getting into it in ruby made it really easy to make those mistakes.  I think in part because most of the ruby code I write is fairly sequential.  We might dress it up in patterns like [ActiveRecord](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_basics.html) or [ActiveJob](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_job_basics.html) and even use [callbacks](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_basics.html#callbacks) or [pub-sub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish–subscribe_pattern), but the fundamental pattern is:

* A web request comes in with some params,
* then we react in the moment to run some action and return a result.

Maybe it kicks off some background processing out of band, but there’s still a fairly straight line.  Crucially you don’t need to worry about maintaining and updating state on long-lived objects because the web request or background job finishes quickly.

With GUI programming things are explicitly more event driven, real-time, and long-lived so to avoid getting into a ball of mud you need to think about separating behaviour and state better.

Frontend patterns like [MVC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model–view–controller) (the original UI one, not the web one popularised by [rails](https://rubyonrails.org)) or reactive programming (as popularised by [react](https://react.dev)) do this really well, and if you want to understand what your frontend colleagues are doing, it’s useful to have tried your hand at it in ruby.  Get into a mess, like I have and you will really understand why you might want to introduce patterns and structure.

*[GUI]: Graphical User Interface
*[UI]: User Interface
*[MVC]: Model View Controller
