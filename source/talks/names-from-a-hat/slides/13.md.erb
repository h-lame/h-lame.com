Aside: actually, don’t watch my talk from last year, instead, go to this URL and watch [“Pursuing Pointlessness” by Chris Howlett](https://brightonruby.com/2024/pursuing-pointlessness/) from [this year’s Brighton Ruby conference](https://brightonruby.com/2024/).  It’s a 5 minute lightning talk that covers the same themes of exploring fun things as my talk, but it takes like 10% of the runtime.  It's so good I'm not even mad about it.<% fnrf 4 %>
