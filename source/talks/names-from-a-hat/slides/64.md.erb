The calculations are interesting because we can change that one number to speed up or slow down the animation.  Right now it’s set to `24` which means roughly, it should take a second to move each name into the hat based on the frame rate.  If I change that to `48` it’ll take two seconds, change it to `12` and it’ll take half a second.

These calculations are sort of annoying and fiddly (ask me later how many times I mixed up `x` and `y` vs. `top` and `left`<% fnrf 9 %>), and you do just need to run it and eyeball it to see if it looks nice or not, which can be frustrating, but it’s a real joy when you do get it right!

Again, I’ve only had to focus on what I need to do for a single frame, and yes it’s more complex than the star jitter, but not really by much.  It’s endlessly tweakable and just … fun?
