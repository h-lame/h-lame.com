The next bit I want to highlight is the animation.  We saw some animation in the last example so you’ll remember we have [an `animate` method](http://shoesrb.com/manual/Element.html#animate) that will call the given block each frame.

I’ve learned from the last example, so the `animate` block here calls a method, instead of having a big inline mess.
