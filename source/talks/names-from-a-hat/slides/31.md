Now we get into something Shoes-y.  [`stack`](http://shoesrb.com/manual/Element.html#stack) defines a UI element container that stacks elements you put into it vertically, in contrast to the other major building block a [`flow`](http://shoesrb.com/manual/Element.html#flow) which flows elements you add to it horizontally.  Yes, these are like [block level](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Block-level_content) and [inline level](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Inline-level_content) elements in HTML.  They’re simple, but give you lots of flexibility.

The methods in the stack there are some of my “other implementation details” that actually render the button and list of names that you saw in the video.
