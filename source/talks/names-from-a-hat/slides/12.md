Why might you want to over-engineer something?

The first reason we’re going to look at is that I wanted to learn about a new feature of ruby.

As part of a lightning talks evening at LRUG I decided to talk about the, at the time new, feature in ruby called `fibers`.  I didn’t know anything about them so I had to go and research how they worked, and _what_ they even were so that I could give the talk about them.

I learn a lot by researching and reading about a topic, but I learn even more if I hold the technology in my hands and try to make something with it.

I had:

1. a problem I knew how to solve - randomising a list of speakers
2. a technology I wanted to explore - ruby fibers

This is the best combination for learning I reckon.  This was the "final thought" of my talk, “Re-interpreting data” last year so I won't belabour the point.  I'll just suggest you find that talk and bask in 45 minutes of …
