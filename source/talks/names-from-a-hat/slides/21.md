Safe between [`Fiber.yield`](https://ruby-doc.org/3.3.6/Fiber.html#method-c-yield) calls in the loop the fiber can do whatever it wants to that array safe in the knowledge that those manipulations wonâ€™t get interrupted by something else.  What it does is [randomly pick a name](https://ruby-doc.org/3.3.6/Array.html#method-i-sample) and [delete it from the list](https://ruby-doc.org/3.3.6/Array.html#method-i-delete), before passing that name out in the [`Fiber.yield`](https://ruby-doc.org/3.3.6/Fiber.html#method-c-yield) call.
