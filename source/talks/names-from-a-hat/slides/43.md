Here’s a simple scene in which I’ve drawn a classic magic top hat, and at the top we have rendered the name of the book we are giving away as a prize.

When you press the button all the names from our list get animated so they go _into_ the hat.  Once they’re all in the hat it starts fizzing with magic energy, and you get a new button with magic words on it.  Pressing _that_ releases some magic energy by picking a name and replacing the book name with the winners name.  You can continue pressing the button until all the names have been chosen - I wrote it this way because we did this giveaway in person and if the winner wasn’t in the room, we just re-ran until someone was present. I’d carried a load of books there, I didn’t want to carry them home again too.

It’s still a shoes app, but I’ve leaned less into text and buttons and more into art + animation, so there’s some neat things to showcase there about how we do that in shoes.
