The next way I over-engineered randomising speakers was to build a UI on top of the process.  I wanted a more visual element to the problem because we would randomise the speakers _on the night_ so I wanted there to be something more interesting to view than some strings in the terminal.  And, I wanted to do it end-to-end in ruby.

At the time, the tool for doing that was to use [Shoes](http://shoesrb.com).  If you've not heard of it, Shoes is one of [_why the lucky stiff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Why_the_lucky_stiff)'s projects.  It's a version of ruby that can be used to build desktop applications.  The UI elements are very similar to what you get with HTML, and positioning and styling is similar to CSS - so it's very familiar if you're doing web stuff for the day job.
