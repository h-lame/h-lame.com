The other versions I shared were pretty much single file scripts — just enough ruby to get the idea out of my head and into an `.rb` file.  This thing, this game?  I couldn’t just do it in a script.  I had to think about the problem and properly model all the pieces.  The domain objects like [`World`s](https://github.com/h-lame/lruggery/blob/4e02855d64a111c8ee72e1a736da7a868384a1f8/names_from_a_hat/rogue/lib/rogue/world.rb), [`Room`s](https://github.com/h-lame/lruggery/blob/4e02855d64a111c8ee72e1a736da7a868384a1f8/names_from_a_hat/rogue/lib/rogue/room.rb), [`Corridor`s](https://github.com/h-lame/lruggery/blob/4e02855d64a111c8ee72e1a736da7a868384a1f8/names_from_a_hat/rogue/lib/rogue/corridor.rb), [`Creature`s](https://github.com/h-lame/lruggery/blob/4e02855d64a111c8ee72e1a736da7a868384a1f8/names_from_a_hat/rogue/lib/rogue/creature.rb) and the infrastructure objects like [`Tile`s](https://github.com/h-lame/lruggery/blob/4e02855d64a111c8ee72e1a736da7a868384a1f8/names_from_a_hat/rogue/lib/rogue/tile.rb), [`TileSet`s](https://github.com/h-lame/lruggery/blob/4e02855d64a111c8ee72e1a736da7a868384a1f8/names_from_a_hat/rogue/lib/rogue/tileset.rb), [`Renderer`s](https://github.com/h-lame/lruggery/blob/4e02855d64a111c8ee72e1a736da7a868384a1f8/names_from_a_hat/rogue/lib/rogue/renderer.rb) and [`GameEngine`s](https://github.com/h-lame/lruggery/blob/4e02855d64a111c8ee72e1a736da7a868384a1f8/names_from_a_hat/rogue/lib/rogue/game_engine.rb).  I had to think about patterns of how things would interact.  I got to use [the visitor design pattern](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/visitor/ruby/example)!

It’s a small enough problem to keep in my head, but it’s a big enough problem to not just YOLO it.

It’s a good exercise to work on something of reasonable scope and get to apply this kind of thinking so I could understand how to apply those ideas in a more professional setting.  Shipping a new feature to production shouldn’t be when you decide to experiment with a radical new way of modelling your business domain.
