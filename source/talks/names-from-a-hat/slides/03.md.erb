A thing I have to do as part of organising that meetup is randomise names of people.  Very often I have needed to choose winners of a raffle or giveaway.  Once we ran a battleships tournament as a practical exercise and I had to pair up the participants to create the playoffs.  For a particularly packed meeting, rather than carefully curating a perfect agenda like [Sarah](https://ruby.social/@sarahmei/) & [Jenny](https://jenny.sh/about)<% fnrf 1 %> have done for the “Weird Ruby” track at this conference, I’ll just randomise the order of the talks.

It happens more than you might think so I like to have a system.

Now, the obvious way to do this is to write everyone's name on a bit of paper, put the bits of paper in a hat, and draw the names one by one to select a winner or generate an order.

And that's _fine_...

But it's not very ruby-y and this _is_ RubyConf, not PaperAndHatsConf, so how can we do this with ruby?
