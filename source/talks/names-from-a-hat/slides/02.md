As my intro mentioned, one of the things I do is co-organise the London Ruby User Group.  LRUG for short â€” if you _really_ stress the L you can pronounce it as El Rug and *sigh* hence the logo.

We meet monthly, on the second Monday of the month, every month.  If you're coming to London you should arrange your holiday to coincide with one of our meetings so you can come chat to us about ruby and learn that the ocean that divides us can be easily bridged by a love of open classes, blocks, and duck typing.
