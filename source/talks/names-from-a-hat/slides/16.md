As more dices appear at random intervals the ruby flips between the two lines until it gets to the end; text: Concurrency control flow, Multiple Threads"

With multiple threads we get the _illusion_ of multiple things happening at once, as represented by two lines of “code”, but it achieves this by giving each thread a tiny bit of CPU time before moving on.

Interrupts tell each thread “stop, it’s someone else’s turn now”.  You’re not in control of when that happens so you have to code _really_ defensively around it to avoid deadlocks and access to shared objects.
