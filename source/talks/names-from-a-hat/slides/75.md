`to_s`-ing the `Tile` is also simple.

If El Rogue is here - we render [the character for that](https://github.com/h-lame/lruggery/blob/4e02855d64a111c8ee72e1a736da7a868384a1f8/names_from_a_hat/rogue/lib/rogue/tile.rb#L29), if there’s a wizard we render [that character](https://github.com/h-lame/lruggery/blob/4e02855d64a111c8ee72e1a736da7a868384a1f8/names_from_a_hat/rogue/lib/rogue/tile.rb#L30), otherwise we render the content.  Which is [the relevant character for floor, wall, empty space, corridor etc…](https://github.com/h-lame/lruggery/blob/4e02855d64a111c8ee72e1a736da7a868384a1f8/names_from_a_hat/rogue/lib/rogue/tile.rb#L12-L28) based on what the `Tile` was told earlier.
