The thing to take away from this, other than, honestly, just how much fun working on animation is, is about how to break a problem down.  With animation, because the block is called 24 times a second, I don’t need to think too much about how to animate things completely, just about what it should do on each frame.  Break the problem down into tiny slices and you can achieve pretty neat results.  This is fairly standard programming advice at the macro scale ([agile](http://agilemanifesto.org) anyone?), so it’s nice to have it apply at the micro scale too.  A good practical reminder of simple things adding up to complex results.
