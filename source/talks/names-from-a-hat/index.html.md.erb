I gave this talk [in November 2024 at RubyConf in Chicago](https://rubyconf.org/schedule/).

A write up of the talk, with all the slides and a full transcript, along with a link to the recording will eventually appear here, but for now, it's the links and "keywords to search for later" I mentioned in the talk.
