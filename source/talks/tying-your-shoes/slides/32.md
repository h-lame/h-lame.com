That’s what this `timer` block is for.  `timer` blocks take an arg to say how many seconds in the future you want the block to fire, and then when that time has passed, the block fires.  Here we use this block to stop the animation.  Remember, everything in Shoes returns what you just built, even `animate` and `timer`.  `timer`s can then be started or stopped.  There’s also the `every` `timer`, for events you want to fire every so often instead of once after a short time has passed.
