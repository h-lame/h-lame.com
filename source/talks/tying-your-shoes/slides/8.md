But unfortunately not. Unlike other ruby GUI frameworks, Shoes is not a gem.  This isn’t a quirky way of packaging it, it’s by design because it’s actually a separate ruby runtime that you download and install.  You then ask Shoes to run the programs you create, instead of your standard ruby install.   It’s based on 1.8.6 though so it should be fine.  It also has gems support (using gems 1.2), so you can still use the ruby eco-system that you know and love, but not specifically the one that you’ve pre-installed.
