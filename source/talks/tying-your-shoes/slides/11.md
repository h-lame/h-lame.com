Anyway, once at `shoooes.net` you can find the version of Shoes for your platform.

It’s cross platform, currently available for OS X (PPC &amp; Intel, although PPC tends to lag behind on some features - it took ages to get Video support into PPC), Windows and Linux / BSD using GTK+.

Download it, install it and you are all set to go!
