To build this login box we need to start with the container for all the elements; the title, the two edit boxes, their labels, and the button.

The box is a `stack`, the second of the two Shoes layout containers.  We’re applying a `margin` to it so it doesn’t fill up the whole window width and is spaced away from the main app title.  Just like CSS we can specify this stuff in array form, or individually with `margin-top` etc…

We’ve now seen both a `flow` (used earlier to contain the main app title) and a `stack` (used here to contain the whole login UI).  So it’s as good a time as any to talk about the features shoes provides for laying out your UI elements.

These are the only two layout containers that Shoes provides, anyone familiar with other GUI frameworks will be used to things like [Grid Layouts](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/layout/grid.html) or [Compass Layouts](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/layout/grid.html) or whatever… nothing so complex with Shoes.
