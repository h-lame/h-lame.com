Ohhh… what’s all this?

So we’re adding a second `background` to add an image, and we’re specifically positioning it with those `bottom` and `right` style entries in the hash.  The positioning stuff should be very familiar to anyone with a passing knowledge of CSS.  For those with more than a passing knowledge you should recognise the multiple backgrounds stuff from CSS3 (which would get rid of things like [the sliding doors technique](https://alistapart.com/article/slidingdoors)).

Next we’re encountering this curious object called a `flow`.  We’ll come back to it later, but for now it’s enough to know that it’s a container that we can put other things in.  Note that we pass a block and everything in that block is evaluated in the context of that `flow`.  So by calling `background` here, we’re setting the background of the `flow`, not our main `Shoes.app`.  (The `curve` param passed the `background` call gives us rounded corners - sweet!)

The final thing is the `title` method.  This lets us specify some text.  Text in Shoes is all based on derivatives of the `para` element and helpfully (much like HTML) provides several default styles to get you started (for example: `title`, `subtitle`, `caption`).  They act much like `h1` - `h6` and simply scale the text up and down in terms of `font-size`.
