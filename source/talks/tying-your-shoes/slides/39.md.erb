So, that’s it.

Hopefully I’ve whetted your appetite for Shoes, if you want to know more there are excellent resources out there about shoes.  First is the shoes manual, which is built into every shoes app.  Press cmd m to make it appear.  Then go and get a copy of [“nobody knows shoes”](https://cloud.github.com/downloads/shoes/shoes/nks.pdf).  Then explore the rest.

I really recommend it<% fnrf 3 %>.
