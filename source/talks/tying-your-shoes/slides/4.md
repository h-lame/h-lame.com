His first attempt at Hackety-hack used an embedded [Gecko](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Gecko) engine and a lot of the UI was pretty much HTML.  However, it seems that this didn’t cut it for some reason, perhaps it was too complex to make changes to or perhaps embedding Gecko was too prone to oddness. I’m not really sure.
