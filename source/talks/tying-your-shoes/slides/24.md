Remember, we are trying to build this.  Now that you know what kinds of layout options are available, and that I’ve already shown you that I’ve got a `stack` box to contain the whole login UI, you should have a pretty good idea of how to combine `stack`s and `flow`s to create the rest of the layout.

It’s four things in a `stack`:

1. the ‘who goes there?’ title
1. the ‘user name’ label and entry
1. the ‘password’ label and entry
1. the login button

And it should be pretty obvious that each label and entry are contained within a `flow`.
