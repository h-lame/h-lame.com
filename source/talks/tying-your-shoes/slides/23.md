Next are `flow`s.  Imagine an empty box of matches.  As you put matches into the box they fill up the bottom layer of the box. Once that layer is full we start filling up the next layer, until that’s filled up and we create a new layer, and so-on.

`flow`s in Shoes are very similar.  UI elements in a `flow` fills up the width of the `flow` from left to right and then drop down horizontally and fill up that layer, and so on.

So that’s layout in Shoes: `stack`s and `flow`s.  Which are, yes, almost exactly like inline vs block elements in HTML &amp; CSS.  Also, just like CSS you can ignore these containers and position things absolutely with `top`, `bottom`, `left` and `right` style attributes.
