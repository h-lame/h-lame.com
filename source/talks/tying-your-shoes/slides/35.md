Shoes has the ability to create custom controls, so if you need a dial or big flippy switch as a UI element, you can combine the drawing stuff I just mentioned and the existing controls and layouts in a class that extends from `Shoes::Widget`.  You can then use these custom widgets inside your Shoes app and not have to worry about repeating code, or having code in the wrong place cluttering up your main logic.
