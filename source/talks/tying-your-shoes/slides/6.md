As you might imagine from something designed to replace an embedded HTML rendering engine, Shoes is heavily influenced by HTML.  To me it’s always felt like a weird combo of HTML, JS and CSS.  Except, rather than learning three syntaxes and splitting everything over three files (if you’re doing it semantically, unobtrusively and presentationally); you’re learning one syntax (ruby) and defining everything in one place.  I think if you’re at all familiar with building apps for the web, you’ll feel completely at home very quickly with Shoes.

It’s also inspired by [Nodebox](https://www.nodebox.net/) and [Processing](https://processing.org/) - so everything is a canvas.  Just imagine that a body tag is also a canvas tag and you’ll be set!
