I mentioned at the start that Shoes is influenced by [Nodebox](https://www.nodebox.net/) and [Processing](https://processing.org/).  Everything is a canvas and it has some really powerful animation (which I touched on) and drawing (which I didn’t) features.  In recent builds _why has been building in more and more features for doing really neat graphical stuff (like filters and alpha transparency).  Thankfully also without sacrificing the simplicity of the API.  Remember, the goal of this is to power Hackety-hack, a tool for teaching kids to program.  Adding this to the fact that you can do pixel perfect layout of elements means you could do some stunning looking animated UIs.  For example, if you wanted a random name generator you could draw a hat that spits out stars and then picks a random name<% fnrf 2 %>.  Or… something good.
