Speaking, as I was just briefly about tidying up the code and so on, I should point out that all the code I’ve shown you has been from one file: [`talon.rb`](https://github.com/h-lame/talon/blob/master/talon.rb).  That’s not to say that you can’t organise your code better.  Shoes has some interesting features that could help this.  I have to say, I’ve not fully explored this aspect of Shoes, so I’m just letting you know that it’s out there.
