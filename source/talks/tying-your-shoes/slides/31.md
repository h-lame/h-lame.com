Shoes has a nifty `animate` method that takes a block that will be run for every frame of your animation (it defaults to 10fps, but can take an arg to say how many fps you want).  What I’m doing here is using another handy element method `displace` to move the whole login UI by employing some *MATHS*.  `displace` is different to `move` because it doesn’t cause the whole UI to reflow, it’s almost like it was intended for this sort of little effect.

If we did nothing else this animation would run forever.
