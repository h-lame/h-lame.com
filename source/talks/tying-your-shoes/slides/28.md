You put the gem statement in a `Shoes.setup` block.  This will tell Shoes that you want to use that gem.  Shoes will also go and download / setup / install that gem if you don’t have it.  Which is pretty cool.

It can be a bit temperamental right now, but it’s only going to get better as Shoes moves on.
