Now that we have a login screen we’re going to need to be able to log into Twitter.  I’ve used the [twitter gem by John Nunemaker](https://rubygems.org/gems/twitter/versions/0.3.6).  But, I mentioned that shoes is it’s own version of ruby, and that it has it’s own version of rubygems, so if you want to use other gems in your app how do you do it?
