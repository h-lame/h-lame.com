So… I could go on and show you how I’ve built the rest of Talon.  It does connect to Twitter and get a list of your friends tweets and even allow you to post a tweet back to Twitter.  But I won’t, I don’t have much time, and I want to briefly mention some other stuff that Shoes does that I didn’t really have the time to build into Talon.  Also, the rest of the Talon code doesn’t really show off anything new, apart from perhaps some other style attributes, or UI elements.
