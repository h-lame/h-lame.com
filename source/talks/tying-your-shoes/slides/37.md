You can extend Shoes itself and this lets you define url endpoints which are methods in your Shoes class that you can call with the `visit` method.  `visit` takes a url, relative or absolute.  You can have regexp’s in the URL and any groups in the pattern become arguments to the method being `visit`ed.  The main advantage here is then being able to put your Shoes code into multiple files.

It’s not clear to me the full power of advantage of this, except for the fact that the urls you `visit` can be absolute, and thus you can put shoes apps online to perhaps combine the power of a desktop app with the simplicity of updating via a central web app.
