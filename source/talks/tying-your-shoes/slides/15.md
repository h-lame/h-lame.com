So let’s spruce it up a bit, we’ll give it a title and give it a nice crisp white background.

We specify the title via a styles hash on the `Shoes.app` call.  We could specify other things here, such as the window size, but we’ll leave that for now.  The default is ok for us.

The background colour is specified as a method.  The block passed to `Shoes.app` is evaluated in the context of the Shoes application.  So this `background` method comes from `Shoes.app`.
