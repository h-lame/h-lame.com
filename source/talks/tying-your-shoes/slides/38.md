Shoes has an excellent in built packaging feature.  From the “Package” menu of any Shoes app you can bundle up your Shoes code, along with Shoes and dependencies, as a Windows, OS X, Linux or Shoes application.  Shoes has [a cross-platform bundle called SHY](https://github.com/shoes/shoes/wiki/A-Developer's-Tour-Through-Shoes#shoes-packager) which you can use instead.

It’s a really simple and nice way of bundling your code, much easier than any other mechanism I’ve used in the past, and it’s awesome that it’s built in.
