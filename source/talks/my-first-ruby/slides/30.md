Anyway, after a couple of false starts we settled on something called [narf](https://rubygems.org/gems/narf/), which appeared to be the most high-level thing at the time.  Now, remember this is me talking about narf as it was in September 2003.  It was version 0.3.4 then, and it got up to 0.7.3 before development appeared to stop in 2005, and some of the docs imply it was headed in a direction that would abstract things further.
