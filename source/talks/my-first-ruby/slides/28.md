…might work.  It’s really a pipeline and, like [Rack](http://rack.github.io/), it might make sense to have a chain of smaller classes linked together, they all take in a mail message and do something to or with it and then pass it on.  That way everything can be tested properly in isolation and it reduces the coupling between things.
