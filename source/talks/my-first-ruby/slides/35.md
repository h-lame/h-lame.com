`showLogin` is effectively the render action for the `"login"` command.  If the user isn’t logged in we want to show them the login page, we’ll call `.showLogin` on the `LoginHandler`.

So, what’s going on here?  Again I’ve defined strings as constants when they really didn’t need to be, it’s all internal.  I’ve also, for no reason abstracted the call to `print_template` out into calling it and the args I’d want to pass to it, I think it was just excitement at using the splat operator.  Nowhere in the code do I ever call `loginTemplateArgs` except in this method, and I can’t think where I’d want to given that the `showLogin` method is simply a pass through to `print_template`.  The only way this might make sense were if it was like this…
