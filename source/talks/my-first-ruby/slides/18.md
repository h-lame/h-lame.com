This code is pretty bad.  I’m massaging a string, I should be using regexp here.  I don’t necessarily agree with using regexp for everything but doing all this string manipulation here would be much better done with regexp.  It wasn’t until a few months into doing ruby professionally (2005-ish I think) that [Jon Lim](http://snowblink.co.uk/) (who I was working with at the time) asked my why I kept using `.slice` and `[]` all the time instead of `.gsub` with a simple regexp.  I think this was a hangover from my Java days where regular expressions were percieved as slow and crappy, and strings were immutable so you did everything with [`StringBuffer`s](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/StringBuffer.html).
