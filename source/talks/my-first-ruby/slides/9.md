My first ruby script was written under the guidance of someone who had been using it for a couple of years.  This probably isn’t that different to many of you though; any code you’ve written has hopefully had the benefit of other people at your job working on the same project, if you’re lucky you’ve even been pair programming with them.  Even if it’s code you’ve written at home, chances are you’ve put it up on github and have the chance of thousands of rubyists looking at it.  Don’t be scared of letting other people look at your code.
