Speaking of reading code, [Chris Lowis](http://chrislowis.co.uk), LRUG’s resident [podcaster](http://lrug.org/podcasts/), recently wrote [a great blog post about open source rails projects and what you can learn from reading the source of them](http://blog.chrislowis.co.uk/2010/05/31/five-rails-apps-to-study-and-learn-from.html).  I think it goes both ways; if you read other people’s code you learn a lot, and if you let other people read your code not only do they learn from you, but so will you when they critique it.  They'll suggest patches for edge-cases you didn’t cover or even a neat re-factoring.  It’s also a nice confidence boost when you read some code for say, [gemcutter](https://github.com/rubygems/gemcutter), and you notice something you think could be improved.

Anyway, aside over.
