To compare what this felt like to me in 2003 it’d help to compare the final code to how I’d do the same thing in Java.

(Well, I think so anyway; my Java is rusty).  This was pretty amazing!  So much less code!  First, there’s the fact that by allowing default values in method signatures I can get rid of that entire 2nd constructor.  Then there’s using the if statement as a statement modifier, by placing it at the end.  I don’t know why, but I’m a massive fan of this format, and I think it’s one of the reasons that I get ruby.  It just reads so neatly.  Finally, there’s a lack of extraneous syntax.

But, you didn’t come here to listen to a talk about why ruby syntax is better than java.  And to be fair to Java in 2003, the syntax is nothing like the mess it is now with generics and annotations.

I think having shown my first “committed” ruby, it’s time to talk about the system as a whole rather than go through it and pick holes in every commit of mine.
