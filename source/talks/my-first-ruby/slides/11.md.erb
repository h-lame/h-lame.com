So.  Here’s the first code I committed to the project.

This probably isn’t the actual first bit of ruby I ever wrote.  As I already mentioned, James had hacked up a prototype and the first commit to our source control was timed at around lunchtime on the Saturday.  It’s 7 years ago so while I can’t remember exactly what we did that day, and I do recall spending a lot of the morning hunting around for a spare ethernet cable.  I’m pretty sure we did some hacking on the code before we decided that [CVS](http://www.nongnu.org/cvs/)<% fnrf 2 %> might be a good idea.

Anyway, I think there’s plenty in here that’s worth talking about.  Why did I add this “empty constructor”.  The commit message says it’s to allow [YAML](http://yaml.org/) to make the object good.  I’m not sure I know what that means, and on the face of it, it looks like I’m just stamping some error checking on here.  I suspect however I was just experimenting with all the fun new things that Ruby can do.
