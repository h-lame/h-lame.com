The next thing we do is add list headers.  We store those as part of the system config and have this object `ListConfiguration`, “an extended Hash with some little things to make it’s use more convenient”.

As a comment at the top.  You know what, I’ve never *ever* used a hash in ruby and thought, “Gee, I wish this was more convenient”, I can’t say I even really think that [the new 1.9 hash syntax](http://breakthebit.org/post/8453341914/ruby-19-and-the-new-hash-syntax) is that much better.  It also shouldn’t extend Hash, it should contain a Hash and delegate the bits of the Hash API that I want and then provide it’s own methods where I want more convience.
