…like these.

Why?  I don’t know.  I just doesn’t make any sense, until you remember my Java routes where these sorts of “magic” strings would be defined as `public static String`s because you’d only want to create that object once (woe betide the Java programmer in the early 2000s who went around creating more objects than they strictly needed to).  Thing is, Ruby has symbols which save one char on typing a string and are more idiomatic.  I can only assume I didn’t know about symbols when I wrote this.  I probably wanted some comfort that I wasn’t spelling a config key wrong and causing a `nil` error so shied away from using strings.  Using constants means I’d get a runtime error saying there’s a missing constant instead of a `nil` error somewhere down the line.
