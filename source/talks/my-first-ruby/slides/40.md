Finally, I want to show some code from the `ArchiveDisplayer`.  The code in here isn’t actually so bad.  Maybe it’s because I wrote this in January 2004 in a week I had off between jobs.  I was clearly more learned, or maybe it’s because one you get past the web stuff, what the code is doing is fairly straightforward.  It just has to go through our disk based archive structure:

> `archive/<year>/<momnth>/<message_id>.msg`

and display the messages.  It has some of the flaws already discussed in that everything happens in one class even when it probably could be decomposed more; it has a mix of view code and model code.  But actually, looking back at it, although the framework is unfamiliar, some of the methods look not too far from what I’d write as view helpers today.
