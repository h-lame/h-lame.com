I’m going to talk to you about the first ruby script I ever wrote.  It’s called *MY* first ruby, but I promise it won’t all be about me.  There’ll be a little bit of personal history, just so you can get an idea of what sort of programmer I was at the time, but most of the talk will focus on the script itself.
