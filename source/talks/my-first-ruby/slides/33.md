Having asked apache to invoke your script, you require the narf libraries and this gives you a `Web` object.  This object is what you interact with to communicate with the webserver.  This is a fragment of our main CGI script.

Apart from showing off my na√Øve ruby stylings (4 space indent! `collect` instead of `map`!) this explains a lot of the narf api:

* `Web[]` to get params that were sent with the request
* `Web.print_template` to invoke some template processing on a file providing a list of variables
* `Web.flush` to send everything back to the webserver
