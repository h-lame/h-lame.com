Then they got bought by Yahoo! and it became [Yahoo! Groups!](https://groups.yahoo.com/)  Basically the same service, but it had a red and blue logo instead of a purple one, and yellow was banished from the UI.

However, and hereâ€™s where we finally get to the ruby script, Yahoo! Groups! started dropping emails intermittently, or taking several days for emails to show up.

As you can imagine, this sort of delay in the inane ramblings of a group of 20-somethings debating the merits of their first jobs during the dot-com era was TOO. MUCH. TO. BEAR!
