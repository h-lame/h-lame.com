Let’s look at some code in one of those handlers:  `UserUpdater`.

This is some of the code that is run when the `'update'` command is sent to the handler.

This code is directly inside the `UserUpdater#do` method.  It’s not even refactored out into it’s own method!  My mind reels at this nowadays, but clearly not in 2003.  We’ve got:

1. view code - I’m building HTML fragments that later I send to a template.
1. model code -
   1. data conversion - converting params from strings into objects
   1. data validation - checking that the data isn’t nil or invalid

Clearly there’s the shock that I’ve had to hand code all this, then there’s the shock that it’s all there mixed up in one method and finally that although we have a `User` class it didn’t even cross our minds to keep this logic inside there.  There’s nothing inside that `User` class that deals with validation.  If I didn’t check that the `sendTo` mail address wasn’t valid here, it would be saved by default by the `User` when I asked it to later in the method.
