Apart from this one.

That doesn’t look *too* bad, until you look at the rest of the method (this is just a fragment).  That last `if` statement (which gets the navigation link or placeholder for taking you from the page you are on to the page for the previous year) is repeated almost in it’s entirety to get the navigation links for the previous month, the next month and the next year.

I remember during my final year in university doing a prolog exercise and getting a good mark for it because somehow I’d managed to bend my mind into making it do a reasonable job at playing noughts and crosses (for a partial board) without using all the memory on the planet.  However one of the negative remarks was for a section of code where I’d repeated some lines without abstracting them into another method call.  “Surely we put this sort of copy and paste behind us in CS1001?”

Apparently almost 4 years later I was still doing it.
