This is what that template looks like.

As you can see here, there are 2 ways of rendering data in these templates.

The first is that, [moustache style](https://mustache.github.io/), it’ll evalutate and render the results of any expressions within `{}` braces. The key/values in the hash you provide to `print_template` are available as `$vars` for evaluation.  Much like the `:locals` hash when rendering a rails partial.

The other way of interacting is to use these `<narf:*>` prefixed tags. Think of them like rails helpers, except instead of looking like code, they look like HTML.  The web community swings back and forth on this sort of thing every so often, should the code in our views look like code (front-enders keep your hands off!) or should it look like markup (front-enders get stuck in!).  I can think of only one templating engine for rails ([radius](https://github.com/jlong/radius) which is used by [radiant](http://radiantcms.org/)) that does it this way though.

Some of the narf tags, like `<narf:foreach>`, would emit things and you could use what was emitted inside the curly braces.  As far as I can tell though, the braces are just for evaluating simple expressions, no logic.  If you wanted logic you have to use narftags.

Anyway, that’s a whistlestop tour of narf as it was.  To be honest it’s clearly early days and some of the things littered in the documentation suggest it was pointed in the right direction (it came with a testing framework and the docs suggested building the app test first using that framework).
