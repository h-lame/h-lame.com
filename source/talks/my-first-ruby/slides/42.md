So that’s my first ruby.  And before I go, I just want to explain why I gave this talk.  Mostly it’s because I hope that after having me come up here and show you this code from 7 years ago, and how bad it is more people will want to get up and show off their code in future meetings.  Either, as I’ve intended, by showing that everyone writes bad code and you needn’t be worried about it.  Or, unintentionally, because you’re worried that if you don’t I’ll turn this into a series of lectures where I talk you through every piece of ruby code I’ve ever written.

Thanks.
