Cast your mind back.  Things were different then.  Summers were longer, the sun was brighter, I had more hair, and ruby 1.8.0 (the grandfather of the version you all know and love) had only just been released that August.

I was in the dying stages of my first job out of university.  I was interviewed to work primarily as a Java programmer; but I ended up doing a load of C++, a bit of VB and some Python GUI development.  It was a great company, but the management decided to move the company offices to Cambridge, which I felt meant I was living the wrong way around; you commute *into* London, not out of it.  I’d never done any Ruby programming, but I did have a taste for dynamic languages having done a lot of (not very OO) Python programming (we used tuples a lot).  I still considered myself a Java programmer, not least because I’d just accepted a job at a Java-based SMS gateway company.
