    text: this method is a bit overkill, but by caching the actual list header object
    instead of having to get it from the main config hash each time we should save
    some overhead. the ListHeaders part is the most frequently accessed, because it
    contains a lot of varied list info.'

This is one of those methods.  Clearly there’s some premature optimisation going on here.  Maybe I misunderstood YAML backed Hashes and though it would always be hitting the YAML file.  Even if I did, don’t optimize until you have to.

Given all that, you know what would be more convenient than having to write that method in the first place…
