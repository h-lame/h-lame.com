So, the first thing that seems weird to me, is that narf isn’t just a library that you include into your scripts.  It also comes with an executable.  As it turns out this executable is there to redirect any exceptions and errors from the ruby process back into the CGI environment.  But this fact is buried as an aside in the docs.  It’s weird.
