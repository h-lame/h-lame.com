Originally we were just going to add the list name in square brackets to the start of the mail, but then we realised we had to do something to prevent various mail clients messing up the re: re: re: re: stuff.  After a tortuous requirements gathering thread we decided to settle on `[list name] <original subject>` and `Re: [list name] <original subject without any re:>`.  As you can might be able to see, this took 3 days and 23 messages to argue about and decide to do the thing we were going to do anyway.  A further argument, if you ever needed it, for not starting a bikeshed discussion if you can possibly get away with it.

There was nothing else about this app that involved this level of debate.
