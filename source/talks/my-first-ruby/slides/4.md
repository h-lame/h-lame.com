I heard of Ruby because my friend, [James Adam](http://lazyatom.com/) (pictured), had been doing a PhD instead of working and while he flirted with Java and Python for a couple of early instalments of his thesis code, he finally settled in about 2001 on Ruby for the majority of his code, and wouldn’t stop going on about it to anyone that would listen.

The prime vehicle for James’ evangelism of Ruby was to send messages a mailing list that our university classmates had set up to keep in touch after we graduated.
