  <% fndf 1 do %>Of minor interest is that this one-click mailman install is what we use to run the [LRUG mailing list][].<% end %>

  <% fndf 2 do %>Not even [SVN][], even though I'm pretty sure I would have been using SVN at work at this stage, so the choice of CVS seems unusual.<% end %>

  <% fndf 3 do %>Of course these days (ruby 1.9x onwards) the default YAML parser is [Psych][].<% end %>

  <% fndf 4 do %>More specifically we implemented [RFC 2369][] and [RFC 2919][].<% end %>

  <% fndf 5 do %>This is true in more ways than one, as both RAA and Rubyforge have both since been shutdown [rubygems.org][] is the preferred way to distribute libraries these days.<% end %>

  <% fndf 6 do %>I think what I'm referring to here is [the announcement of rip as an alternative][rubygems-alternative-rip].  I can't really remember, but rubygems did last and rip didn't so maybe it doesn't really matter.<% end %>

  <% fndf 7 do %>I'm not really sure which library I'm referring to here.  I might mean [`fcgi`][fcgi], but that's always been called `fcgi` or `fastcgi`, not `ruby_fastcgi` as far as I can tell.  It's possible I mean some long forgotten binding that no longer exists.<% end %>

I gave this talk at the [June 2010 meeting of the London Ruby User Group](http://lrug.org/meetings/2010/june/).  Accordingly some of the things in it might be out of date, particularly references to versions of software.

The transcript below comes from the presenter notes so represents a perfect version, which is unlikely to be exactly what I said on the night.
