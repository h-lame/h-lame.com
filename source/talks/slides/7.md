## [The long road to ruby 3.0 vs. the short road to ruby 3.1](/talks/the-long-road-to-ruby-3-0-vs-the-short-road-to-ruby-3-1/)

A talk I gave sharing how the team at [Cleo](https://www.meetcleo.com/) meticulously planned and delivered the upgrade to ruby 3.0 on our rails app so smoothly that we became drunk on our own competence and totally messed up our upgrade to ruby 3.1 the following week. A rare talk where you will learn some best and worst practices.
