  <% fndf(1) do %>We’ve since dropped the “Consulting” part of the brand.<% end %>

  <% fndf(2) do %>Obviously this slide is quite out of date, I’d update it each time I gave the talk as new versions of ruby and ruby on rails were released.<% end %>

  <% fndf(3) do %>Intentionally or not, what I’m describing here is the structure of a [code retreat][], even down to picking Game of Life as the project to work on.<% end %>

  <% fndf(4) do %>The first railsgirls event in London was in [March 2013][first-railsgirls-event].<% end %>

  <% fndf(5) do %>The talks were run close to the next LRUG meeting so I’d update this slide each time I gave the talk to have info about the specific meeting.<% end %>

  <% fndf(6) do %>This slide is hugely out of date, some of the groups I mention appear to have died out abnd others may have cropped up in other towns ([Bath][bath-ruby-group] and [Norwich][norwich-ruby-group] are two I know about).  It’s a shame when groups die out, but it can’t be helped.  It’s easy to start a group, it *is* hard to keep it going.<% end %>

  <% fndf(7) do %>Another slide that is pretty out of date.  It seems clear that Scottish Ruby is permanently closed, and while Bath Ruby had a 2nd iteration in 2016 they announced it wasn’t happening in 2017.  Brighton Ruby seems to be the only regular ruby conference in the UK now and thankfully it goes from strength-to-strength.  Ruby Manor may return, but we’re in no rush.<% end %>

  <% fndf(8) do %>RuPy rebranded as [PolyConf][] for 2014, so this slide was out of date almost as soon as I wrote it.<% end %>

I gave this talk at several times between 2013 and 2015 to the students of the [General Assembly web development immersive course](https://generalassemb.ly/education/web-development-immersive).  They were learning ruby and ruby on rails as part of this course and the goal of the talk was to introduce them to the ruby scene in London.

The talk is split into two parts.  In [the first part](#part-1) I try to convince them that becoming part of a tech community outside work and study is a good idea.  Hopefully having convinced them of this [the second part](#part-2) introduces the various ruby communities in London and beyond.

The transcript comes from my presenter notes so aren’t an exact copy of what I said.  The talk mentions events and versions of software which are clearly out of date now, but were current when I gave the talk.  I’d update the notes each time I gave the talk and the version presented here uses the notes from the last time I gave the talk in September 2015.
