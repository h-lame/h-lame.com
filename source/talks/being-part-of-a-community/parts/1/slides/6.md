So, you’re going to spend a lot of time reading stuff or watching videos.  But that’s not all,  there are 2 other ways to learn; practice and discussion, and you need to be comfortable with them both.

There’s an excellent talk called [“From Artist To Programmer”](http://srcvideo2010.herokuapp.com/show_video/4/1) given by [Keavy McMinn](http://keavy.co.uk/) at the [Scottish Ruby Conference in 2010](http://scottishrubyconference.com) that I think cover both of these types of learning really well.

She talks about her time at art school and how there’s stuff we could learn from that to improve our craft as programmers.
