So, who am I to be talking to you…

I first used ruby in 2003, have been paid to use it since 2006, and have been organising [LRUG](http://lrug.org/) since 2007.  I work for an agency called [Unboxed Consulting](http://unboxed.co/)<% fnrf 1 %> that specialises in agile and ruby on rails.  If after this course you are looking for work as a ruby dev, you could do worse than getting in touch with us to see if we’re hiring.
