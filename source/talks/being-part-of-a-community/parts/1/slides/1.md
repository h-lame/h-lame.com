Hi!

You’ve all been learning ruby here at General Assembly for the last 4 or 5 weeks, and I’ve been asked me along to talk to you about the ruby community outside of these 4 walls.  Some of you might have already been looking around to see what else is out there, and that’s great, I hope I don’t bore you too much!  For the rest of you this should act as a an introduction to that community and an explanation of why you might care.

I’m mostly going to talk about the ruby community in London, but I’ll also cover the rest of the UK, Europe and further afield.  The world is small now so it’s good to know what is going on elsewhere.

Before we start properly, there’ll be urls in these slides, and I’ll mention things you should look up, but don’t worry about making notes:  I’ll send a PDF round afterwards.  There’ll be time for questions at the end too, but feel free to ask anything along the way.  So.. let’s get started.
