As an artist you spend a long part of your training just sketching the same thing over and over again in different styles.  It helps hone your craft as an artist.

Her point, and I agree, is that as programmers we should do the same thing.  So every so often, take a break from day-to-day work to run through a simple problem and work on something entirely different, just to let you flex your coding muscles in a different way.  Look at things like coding [dojos](http://code.joejag.com/2009/the-coding-dojo.html), [katas](http://codekata.com/), [koans](http://rubykoans.com/), or [“programming quiz” challenges](http://rubyquiz.com/) and try to do one of those once a week, or once a month or something.

Also consider having your “pet problem” to try out new technologies on.  Pick a problem you know how to solve (a blogging app, a todo list, some kind of fun algorithm like [Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life), whatever your final project is here) and then try to solve it in a different way (use different libraries, a different programming language, force a constraint like no `if` statements).  This lets you focus on the technology challenges rather than the problem<% fnrf 3 %>.
