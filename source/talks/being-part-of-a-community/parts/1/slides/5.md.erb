always. be. learning.

Seriously.  It’s what being a developer is.  Let’s think about the technology you’ve been learning so far: [Ruby on Rails](http://www.rubyonrails.org/).

[Ruby](http://ruby-lang.org) is now 2.2, but that [came out at the end of last year](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2014/12/25/ruby-2-2-0-released/), and development on 2.3 is underway; it’s probably coming out towards the end of this year.  Rails is currently at version 4.2, also [released at the end of last year](http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2014/12/19/Rails-4-2-final/) and the core team are already talking about what version 5.0 might contain; there were [some hints at this years RailsConf](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJVTM7mE1Cc)<% fnrf 2 %>.  Each of those brings new APIs and new ways of doing things.  And that’s just the two main technologies; there’s loads of other libraries involved and all of those are constantly upgrading.

I spend a good chunk of each month reading blog posts about new technology, or new approaches to old problems; watching videos of talks online; reading bug reports and wiki pages of software tools I want to use to evaluate them.  I even spend a good chunk of each day googling for the correct API syntax to use!

I don’t say this to daunt you.  Just to put your mind at ease, I’m sure that right now you think “oh there’s so much to learn”, and you’re worried about how you’ll get it all.  That is what every developer is feeling ALL THE TIME.  Just don’t worry about it, what you’re really learning is a very acute and hyper-powerful ability to seek out information.  It’s daunting, but it’s exciting.
