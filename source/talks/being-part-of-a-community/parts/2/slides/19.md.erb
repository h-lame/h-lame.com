The major UK ruby conference was [Scottish Ruby Conf](http://scottishrubyconference.com/), now in it’s 6th year, based up in or near Edinburgh.  It’s the UK equivalent of a major US conference; multi-day, multi-track, big-name keynote speakers, swag, the works!  I say was because last year they said it would be the last one.  I think because the organisers mostly weren’t using ruby in their day-jobs anymore - but we’re all expecting that something similar by the same folk will happen in it’s place, so keep an eye out for something from them.  All the videos from the previous editions are available and there are some great talks, so at the very least have a look at what’s available already!

The first [Bath Ruby](http://bathruby.org/) happened earlier this year in March.  I wasn’t able to attend this conference, but heard really good things.  It had a impressive line up of speakers, and was quite cheap (less than £100).  [Videos are coming soon](http://confreaks.tv/events/bathruby2015).

There’s [Brighton Ruby](http://brightonruby.com), the second of which was a couple of weeks ago.  Looks to be coming back next year too, in a bigger venue.  The [first year](http://brightonruby.com/2014/) wasn’t filmed, but this year was and they’ll be [coming out later in the year](http://brightonruby.com/2015/).

Finally there’s [Ruby Manor](http://rubymanor.org) (full disclosure: I organise this with a couple of friends), based in London, there’s been 4 so far, but it’s not entirely regular (and we’re not sure we’ll do another, but never say never).  It’s the opposite of Scottish Ruby Conf; community driven, one-day, one-track, no frills.  All our videos are available [on our website](http://rubymanor.org).

There are loads of other conferences in the UK though, not just about Ruby and you should definitely use [lanyrd.com](http://lanyrd.com/topics/ruby) to try and keep up.  Sometimes the first I hear about something is the stream of tweets from attendees talking about how good it is!<% fnrf 7 %>
