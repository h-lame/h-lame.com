David A. Black is an influential rubyist: co-founder of [Ruby Central](http://rubycentral.org/) that amongst other things helps put on the [RubyConf](http://rubycentral.org/rubyconf) and [RailsConf](http://rubycentral.org/railsconf) conferences in America); author of “[Ruby for Rails](http://www.manning.com/black/)” and “[The Well Grounded Rubyist](http://www.manning.com/black2/)” - you should try to pick up one of these.  Both are a few years old now, and Well Grounded Rubyist is actually version 2 of Ruby for Rails, but they’re both good books for the folk new to ruby.  I used to caveat this recommendation because Well Grounded Rubyist was quite old (it covered Rails 2), but the [2nd edition](http://www.manning.com/black3/) of it came out at the end of last year and is fully up to date.  So do go get a copy!
