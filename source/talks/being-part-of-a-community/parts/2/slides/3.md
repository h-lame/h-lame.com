…turned into [Codebar](http://codebar.io).

It’s not just Ruby, (they cover html, css, javascript too), but it’s a weekly learning event every Wednesday evening in various venues around London.

As they are focussed on improving diversity in tech, it has [strict eligibility criteria for students](http://codebar.io/student-guide#eligibility), which not all of you will meet.  I mention it to you because it’s open to everyone to act as coaches so you should all think about attending in that capacity.  You might think “I’m just learning myself, what can I coach someone on?”, but it’s useful for coaches who have recently been newbies themselves to help out:

1. it’s great for you to help folk as a way to help cement your own understanding of things
1. if someone asked me “what’s a good resource to learn ruby” - I can’t answer, as it’s nearly 10 years since I had to.  If someon asks you however, it’s only been a few months since you started the same journey so you’re full of tips about stuff you’ve used recently that you can pass on.

They started in London, but there are now regular meetings in Brighton, Birmingham, and Cambridge too.  The London meetings are so popular they now have three chapters every week!

They even run a few day long event called, their most recent was [Mind the Code on June 6th in London](https://codebar.io/events/mind-the-code), and are planning one in [October called Uncodebar](https://codebar.io/events/uncodebar).  It’s a great community you should get involved.
