* [the website: lrug.org](http://lrug.org/) - mostly just meeting updates.
* [the readme: readme.lrug.org](http://readme.lrug.org/) - code of conduct, info about how to speak, sponsor, etc.
* [on twitter as @lrug](https://twitter.com/lrug) - mostly just meeting updates, but it sometimes retweets other london ruby goings on.
* [sign up to our mailing list at lrug.org/mailing-list](http://lrug.org/mailing-list) - we try to keep it on topic as some people are very precious about their inboxes. Usually lots of job offers on here, but it’s good to ask questions on here too - some great threads in the [archives](http://lists.lrug.org/pipermail/chat-lrug.org/).
* [via our lanyrd series - lanyrd.com/series/lrug](http://lanyrd.com/series/lrug) - the meetings go up on [lrug.org](http://lrug.org/) and [skills matter’s website](https://skillsmatter.com/groups/3-london-ruby-user-group) as the official places, but lanyrd is a great service so we use that too, mostly for calendar reminders, but once you’re signed up it tells you about other events that you might be interested in.
* [freenode#lrug for IRC](http://lrug.org/irc/) - normally silent, but who knows - I’ve not logged in for months it might be happening these days, used to be good if you wanted a more conversational question.
* [github.com/lrug](https://github.com/lrug) - a bunch of repos that have something to do with lrug.  Both [lrug.org](http://lrug.org/) and [readme.lrug.org](http://readme.lrug.org/) live here so if you see anything you’d like to change, you can submit a PR.  We also have some repos from practical events we’ve done, and some scripts I have written to randomise order of talks for the lightning talk evenings.
* [lrug.org/podcast](http://lrug.org/podcast) - there are 5 episodes - interviews with speakers or notable folk from the lrug community (including an episode with me, fair warning). If you like them do talk to the host [Chris Lowis](https://twitter.com/chrislowis) at the next meeting you go to and convince him to do more!
* [lrug.org/nights](http://lrug.org/nights) - occasionally we just do the pub bit (although we havenʼt for a while).  The plan here was that anyone could organise it and they would pass on the baton to someone else on the night ([The logo](http://assets.lrug.org/images/lrug-nights-logo.png) is based on the tv series [Baywatch Nights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baywatch_Nights)).
