…we go to a pub for [a more informal get together](http://flickr.com/photos/snowblink/3890552430/).

If you don’t drink that’s fine; there’s no pressure - we try to make sure the pub we attend has plenty of seating and serves food so that people can just talk and network.  It really is a great opportunity as the speakers are usually in attendance so you can talk to them in more detail about their talk if you were particularly interested in it.

It’s worth pointing out that many people from my “circle of peers” come from this part of the meeting.
