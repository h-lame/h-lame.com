[LRUG](http://lrug.org/) is the main group.  Although I would say that because I’m the organiser of it.

We meet on the 2nd Monday of the month, hosted by [Skills Matter](https://skillsmatter.com/) who have just moved to a new venue [between Liverpool St. and Moorgate](https://skillsmatter.com/event-space).  We have maybe 100 people come along to an average meeting, but it’s been known to go up to ~160 or so for a very popular meeting.  The new space might allow us to grow even more.
