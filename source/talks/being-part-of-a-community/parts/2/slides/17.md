I’m not going to list them all, you’ve seen how many are in the UK.  Ruby is pretty popular, so chances are there’s some kind of group wherever you might look.  If you’re on holiday then you’re probably not that far from a group, put out a message on twitter, someone will take you to the pub and talk about ruby at you if you want it!

[rubyusergroups.org](http://rubyusergroups.org/) is a good place to find out more.
