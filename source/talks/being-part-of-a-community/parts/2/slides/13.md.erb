So I said we meet on the 2nd Monday of the month, that means the next one is due on [September 14th](http://lrug.org/meetings/2015/september/)<% fnrf 5 %>.

Thereâ€™ll be three talks:

* [blameless reviews](https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts/6591-learning-through-blameless-reviews) - how to do pull-request code-reviews in a constructive way)
* [seal](https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts/6584-how-to-onboard-junior-developers-well-by-tatiana-soukiassian) - about a 20% project to build a slack integration for reminding you about open pull-requests
* [container patterns](https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts/6585-containers-patterns-for-rails) - about using docker and similar container technologies to deploy rails applications
