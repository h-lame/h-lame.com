Anyway, LRUG in it’s current incarnation was started in 2005 just around the time Ruby (because of Rails) was becoming tech you might actually get paid to do.  I started attending when I switched from Java to Ruby in 2006.  Back then we probably had about 30 people on a good day.  I took over organisational duties in January 2007.  The popularity of rails has really swelled the numbers as we went up to 80 - 100 average attendance really quickly after that (nothing to do with my organisational skills).

Our meetings have a pretty set pattern.  They’re split in two, from 6:30pm to 8pm we have the formal proceedings.
