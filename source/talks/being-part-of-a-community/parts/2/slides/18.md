Of course, user groups aren’t the only way to get involved.  There are the conferences.  So many conferences.

A user group is usually a fairly informal, local get together where most attendees will know each other.  Maybe in a big place it’ll be 100 people or more (LRUG can get up to 160 for a VERY popular event).  A conference on the other hand is likely to be at least that size, but usually much bigger and draw attendees from much further afield, not just the local community.  They’re usually a whole day of talks, often 2 or maybe 3 days for a big conference.  It’s a good chance to meet the authors of the libraries you use, or chat to people you wouldn’t normally be exposed to.

A good site that is ruby specific is [rubyconferences.org](http://rubyconferences.org/); it lists upcoming ruby confs with an option to filter by CFP if you want to talk etc…  I think it’s manually updated though.

A much more comprehensive site is [lanyrd.com](http://lanyrd.com/) - although you can’t just see conferences, you’ll see user groups and basically [everything tagged with ruby](http://lanyrd.com/topics/ruby) on there.

A new entry is [https://github.com/planetruby/awesome-events](https://github.com/planetruby/awesome-events) which is a github repo and command line tool - you can raise a PR to add an event and you can see it online, or use their tool to find out what’s upcoming.
