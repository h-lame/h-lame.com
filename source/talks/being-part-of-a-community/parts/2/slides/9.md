They look [a lot like this](http://flickr.com/photos/snowblink/2574309878/). Note that the expression on these people’s faces is “rapt with attention”, not “boredom”.

The normal agenda is that we have “announcements” from the group, then at least two talks, sometimes 3, occasionally more.  Usually about something ruby related, but it can be about general development topics or technologies we might want to use ruby to interact with.

Sometimes we do different things, for example in February we have our lightning talk event where we have 8 or 9 speakers doing 5-8 minute talks.   We’ve done practical events like code golf or a coding dojo too.  We try to mix it up when we get the chance.

When the talks are done…
