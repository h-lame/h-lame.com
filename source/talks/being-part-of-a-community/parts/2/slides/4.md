The next group to talk about is [RubyBizUK](http://rubybizuk.com/).

It was started in May 2009 as a daytime meetup for folk who use ruby, but it’s notionally business focussed.  Less about developer technique, more about business technique.  They meet up on the 2nd Wednesday of the month and have just moved to [Lantana in Shorditch](http://lantanacafe.co.uk/lantana-cafe-shoreditch/).

They say:

> Let’s get together and chat about best practice Ruby Development, and do some good old fashioned business networking. Mostly for Ruby consultants and owners of software development shops, although any people interested in the subject are welcome!

It’s pretty informal, just a coffee and chat really, but very good resource if you have flexible working arrangements.  It’s a good mix of people too, not just developers, but other people interested in running a business with ruby - I’ve met recruiters, accountants, and people looking for a business partner at these events.

The next meeting is: Wednesday October 14th! (They just had the September one on the 10th)
