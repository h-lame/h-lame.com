I won’t mention them all, seriously, there are LOADS!

Just pick out a few that are “important”.

First up, and closest to home is: [EuRuKo](http://euruko.org)

It’s the major ruby conf in europe and doesn’t have a permanent home.  Instead the attendees vote for which city to hold it in the following year.  It’s was in [Athens in 2013](http://euruko2013.org/) and was supposed to be in [Kiev in 2014](http://www.euruko2014.org) (but they had to [cancel because of the political situation](http://www.euruko2014.org/#blog/post/1/) - shame).  Happily they’re organising it this year (2015) in [Salzburg, Austria](http://www.euruko2015.org/) and tickets are on sale for just €65.

There’s another smaller conf called [RuPy](http://rupy.eu/) that does a similar thing, and it covers both Ruby and Python<% footnote_reference 8 %>.

The US hosts the two biggest confs for rubyists: [RailsConf](http://railsconf.com/) and [RubyConf](http://rubyconf.org/).  Again, both tour, hitting a different city each year.  RailsConf this year (2015) was in [Atlanta, Georgia at the end of April](http://railsconf.com/2015), so keep an eye out for the 2016 version. RubyConf will be in [San Antonio, Texas on 15th-17th Nov](http://confreaks.com/events/rubyconf2015).  These are huge affairs, Rails Conf is proably a 1,000 or so attendees these days.

And the regional confs. Too many to list, but it can often feel like there’s a ruby conf every other weekend in the states.  Again, if you’re planning on visiting the states it might be a good idea to see what is happening in the ruby scene, there might just be a conf on!

Japan hosts the other major conference: [Ruby Kaigi](http://rubykaigi.org/).  Many presentations are in Japanese, but they have live translation into English (and vice-versa for talks presented in English).  The Japanese community is quite different to the western community as many Japanese rubyists are C programers who work on ruby itself.

These past couple of slides have probably been a bit overwhelming.  I’m not saying you should spend all your spare time going to conferences; not least because it would be prohibitively expensive and destructive to the planet!  But, most confs publish videos of their talks, so you should keep an eye out for people at conferences mentioning great talks and then watch them when they’re released!  Much cheaper!

But you should try to go to some conferences.  They are great ways to meet people and learn loads of new things.
