If you’re based near London, but not in London, maybe you’d want to hit up some of the User Groups.  There are regular groups in [Ipswich (IPRug)](http://iprug.org/), [Oxford (OXRUG)](http://www.meetup.com/Oxford-Ruby-Users-Group-OxRUG/), and [CAMRUG in Cambridge](http://www.meetup.com/Cambridge-Ruby-User-Group/).  Further afield there’s the [BRUG, the Bristol group](https://www.meetup.com/bristol-ruby-user-group/), [cardiff.rb in Cardiff](http://www.cardiffrb.com/) and [WMRUG in Birmingham](http://www.meetup.com/West-Midlands-Ruby-User-Group-WMRUG/).  There’s a few on-again-off-again groups: [surrey rubyists (based in Guildford)](http://surreyrubyists.tumblr.com/), and [BRUG (2) in Brighton](http://brightonruby.org/) too.  Maybe you could be the person that keeps them going?

[leeds ruby thing in Leeds](https://www.meetup.com/LeedsRubyThing/), [NWRUG in Manchester](http://nwrug.org/), [SHRUG in Sheffield](https://shrug.org/), and [ncl.rb in Newcastle](https://twitter.com/rubynortheast) also have regular meetings with strong communities.  Finally there’s [ScotRug](http://scotrug.org/) which is mostly based in Edinburgh, but there are occasional meetings in Glasgow and Aberdeen too.

No matter where you are in the UK, it should be possible for you to find a Ruby meetup and wherever you find a ruby meetup it means there are people being paid to use ruby in local companies.   Which in turn means you can live there and be paid to use ruby.  Don’t let anyone tell you that you have to stay in London to work in technology.

If there isn’t a ruby group, just start one, it’s not hard!  I can give you some advice afterwards if you want it, but all you need to do is let people know you’re doing it<% fnrf 6 %>.
