However...

What if your test suite was more like [this Covid era Flaming Lips gig](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-55794674) where every audience member is contained safely in a lovely [Zorb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zorbing) and cannot be influenced or interrupted by any of the other audience members?  You can all enjoy this lovely night out without having beer spilled on you, unless you spilled beer on you yourself, but that's okay, because that's you. That's your test doing that. That's fine.

So yes, a lot more effort and maybe not quite as much fun, but everyone gets a safe night out.

Cool.
