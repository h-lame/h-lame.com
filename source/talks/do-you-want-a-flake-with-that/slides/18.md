We fixed this after I spotted it a bunch of times in our code by running the [rubocop Naming/FileName cop](https://docs.rubocop.org/rubocop/cops_naming.html#namingfilename) on our test files, which we normally don't do, because who cares about the names of your tests?  Turns out _we_ do.

We run that and it complains when the file name and the class name don't match.  It's a bit annoying, because then you have to make your class names and file names match in all the tests, and sometimes that's not what you actually want, because the file name is a placeholder for a bunch of more helpfully named tests.  But you have to go through it and you solve it, and then you no longer have that problem.
