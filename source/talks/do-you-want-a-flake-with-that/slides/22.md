The other thing about the real world is randomness. There are many reasons that we might want to involve random elements in our applications.

* maybe for generating secure passwords
* maybe for generating user ids
* maybe our website is a D&D application and we want to roll d20s for people.

There are lots of reasons we want random elements in our production systems. But we _don't_ want random elements in our tests.

For example, if you [have a factory](https://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_bot) and you put random names into user profiles, at some point, one of your names may breach some guidelines you have from a third party about how long names are allowed to be.  And we all know, we've all read [that website](https://www.kalzumeus.com/2010/06/17/falsehoods-programmers-believe-about-names/). _We_ know that there are lots of things we don't agree about, understand, or know about names, but turns out your third parties haven't read [that website](https://www.kalzumeus.com/2010/06/17/falsehoods-programmers-believe-about-names/), and they think names can only be 30 characters long! Apparently.

If you have a random element in your factory, at some point, you'll get random data in your test, and your test will be like, "oh, I didn't expect it to be this long or not that long", and it will fail.  So don't use random elements at all.

Or, if you must use random elements, like for your d20 roller, seed it. [Seeding the value of the random number generator](https://ruby-doc.org/3.3.0/Random.html#method-c-srand) in your test means it always uses the same random number generation -- when you roll it the first time, it always gives you a 1, and when you roll a second time it always gives you a 5.  Then your tests will never fail, because you've said "random number generator, always generate me this number".  Or, at least, they'll be consistent.

Or we can [stub](https://mocha.jamesmead.org/#partial-mocking) the service to always return the exact number we care about, or the exact random element that we care about and this means we avoid the issues of random stuff happening in our tests.

And just to belabour the point, really, _really_ don't use random elements in your factories.  Friends don't let friends use [the faker gem](https://github.com/faker-ruby/faker) in their factories.
