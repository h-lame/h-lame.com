I've got 3 possible isolation breaches that we're going to talk about:

1. The first one is other tests: other tests have done something that hasn't cleaned up the world and has left it in a weird state, and that is impacting us.
2. The second problem is the real world: our tests have to interact with the real world, and mostly I'm just going to moan about time.
3. The third one is that we have to talk to external systems: we maybe don't control them so we can't set them up in our world exactly as we want them to be.
