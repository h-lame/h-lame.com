Those are some things that I have seen about how tests have been flaky in the past, in applications that I have written.

If we are thinking about those things when we're writing the tests and we do all that good best practice stuff then we're going to avoid any flaky tests.

But ... the reality is it's _not_ going to solve the problem.  Our test suite still has flaky tests, even though I gave this in January over a year ago and everyone does exactly what I say.

So how do we find and fix flaky tests when they happen?
