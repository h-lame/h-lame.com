Similarly, you may have a system that uses some kind of caching.  If one test puts something into the cache, your next test may behave differently, based on what is in that cache, so you can do a bunch of things there:

You could use the [`ActiveSupport::Cache::NullStore`](https://api.rubyonrails.org/v7.1.3/classes/ActiveSupport/Cache/NullStore.html), which means you have a cache, but it only stores things for the duration of the block. It doesn't store them outside of that block.

Or ...

You can make sure to always empty your caches in your `teardown`s.
