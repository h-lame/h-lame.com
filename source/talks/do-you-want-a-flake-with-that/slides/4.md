My central thesis is that tests work best in isolation. Now, [Fred](https://ruby.social/@fglc2)'s just given us [an amazing talk](https://lrug.org/meetings/2024/april/#what-the-chernobyl-disaster-can-teach-us-about-incident-response), using an extended metaphor about Chernobyl, and I am also going to try an amazing metaphor. So hold on to your hats.
