Okay, so that's other tests.  The tl;dr of which is:

* do stuff in your `setup`
* make sure you undo it in your `teardown`

Do _that_ and you'll be fine.

The next thing to talk about is the real world.

As a person who exists and is getting older: I hate time.  As a programmer: I _really_ hate time.

Time is ... time is _weird_.  There are calendars, and business days, and leap days, and leap seconds, and time zones, and date math, and date manipulation, and Gregorian versus Julian calendars, and ... I hate it all so much because I'm a programmer, and I. Just. Hate. It.

Any programming that has to deal with time, or worse, dates, or _both_ is a nightmare. If you've ever done anything with calendars in your product, you will know what I mean, and tests are no exception to this.
