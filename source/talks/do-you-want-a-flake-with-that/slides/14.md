Sometimes you might want to change how a underlying library behaves. So, for example, we use [sidekiq](https://sidekiq.org) (secretly, our app is a sidekiq monolith, not a rails monolith).

It has different ways of running.  In testing mode you can [set it to "inline" mode](https://github.com/sidekiq/sidekiq/wiki/Testing#testing-workers-inline) which means when we push a job to the background, actually run it, versus, I think the default mode is to not do that and do something else.  I think maybe [just record that a job has been pushed to the queue](https://github.com/sidekiq/sidekiq/wiki/Testing#testing-worker-queueing-fake).  So you can tell sidekiq, "hey? Can you run in this mode, please?"

If you do that in one test and don't undo it, then your next test may not expect that, and you'll get failures because the job has or hasn't run, depending on what you really wanted.

Probably lots of your other libraries have similar modes like this. We use [AASM](https://github.com/aasm/aasm), which is "Acts As State Machine". It has a mode where you can [turn on throwing exceptions if you do a transition with an event that you're not really allowed](https://www.rubydoc.info/gems/aasm/AASM%2FConfiguration:whiny_transitions), or it can be told to not do that.  You may want to turn it on or off in your test, depending on what you're doing.  If you forget to _undo_ that?  Problems.

You should make sure you undo those changes in your `teardown`, or you can see if your library provides helpful block methods that you can put in an `around` wrapper that will run around all of your test cases to change the mode for the tests where you actually care about that behaviour.
