Even if our tests are fast, time does march _inexorably_ onwards.

That means that sometimes the test will run such that it crosses a second, or it crosses an hour, or it crosses a day, or a month, or _something_ like that, which means what you thought was true about time at the start of the test is now different to the end of the test.

So you compare times and annoyingly when you say "oh, expect that it's today", it's not today anymore, because you ran it at midnight. Haha! Joke's on you.

There are lots of solutions to this where you use [the timecop gem](https://github.com/travisjeffery/timecop), or you use [the time helpers that come with ActiveSupport](https://api.rubyonrails.org/v7.1.3/classes/ActiveSupport/Testing/TimeHelpers.html) to say "Time no longer moves!  Freeze time!" and then your test doesn't have to deal with time moving, and that is _weird_, but it will stop some functionality of your tests failing because you've skipped over a boundary that you didn't expect.
