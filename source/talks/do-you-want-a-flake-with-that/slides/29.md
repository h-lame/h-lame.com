The first thing you're going to want to do is to replicate it.  Chances are you're not running the test suite and getting flaky failures on your local build, or, you don't care about them because they're not stopping you from deploying.  It's the flaky build on your CI platform.  We use [circle](https://circleci.com), you maybe use [github actions](https://github.com/features/actions) or [buildkite](https://buildkite.com) or something else I've not heard of.  Whatever it is you use, it will tell you what test actually failed.

If you are lucky you just grab the name of the failing test and when you run it, it fails locally for you.  But if that was the case, _why did you commit it_?

So we're going to have to do something else.
