The problem is when everything that you hoped was isolated in those 4 stages is not true.  Something _else_ happened!

1. When you set up the world, it turns out it didn't actually look how you expected.
2. When you exercised in the world, the change didn't apply in the way that you expected.
3. Verification then fails, obviously, because what you expected to happen ... didn't.
4. Maybe when you tore things down it didn't reset the world.

Something has happened, and isolation has been breached.

And that's my central thesis.
