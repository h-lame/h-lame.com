My central thesis is that tests work best in isolation.  Most tests achieve this using the 4 phase testing pattern.  How this works is that when you run a test:

1. First you set it up: you make the world look like you want it to.
2. Next you exercise: you do something that you expect to change the world.
3. Then you verify: you check that the change you applied has mutated the world in the way you expected.
4. And finally, you tear down:  you burn the world down, reset it back to as if nothing had ever happened.  Nothing in your setup.  Nothing in your exercise.  You probably shouldn't change the world in your verify, but if you did, nothing that happened there _has_ happened, and your world is back to step 0.
