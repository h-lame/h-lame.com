Something else that might be problematic is that you might be testing the behaviour of your system depending on some environment variables.  You might set the environment variable in one test, but don't unset it.  Your next test doesn't expect the environment variable to be set to, for example, run all of these A/B tests, but your system under test says, "Oh, right, the environment variable is set to run all these A/B tests", and so when your test runs, the system behaves differently to how it expected it to, and the test fails.

We can fix that by [stubbing `ENV`](https://mocha.jamesmead.org) or [stubbing the things that act based on `ENV`](https://rspec.info/documentation/3.13/rspec-mocks/) to say, "I don't care what you say, but this is how you're supposed to behave right now".

There is a gem called [climate control](https://github.com/thoughtbot/climate_control) that lets you effectively handle stubbing of the environment.  You use a block to say, "Oh, set the environment to this, run the code, then unset it."

Those are some things you can do to avoid flaky tests by controlling how and when you make changes to the environment.
