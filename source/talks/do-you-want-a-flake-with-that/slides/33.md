Elsewhere, if this talk wasn't enough:

1. There was a really good talk at Rubyconf in November by Alan Ridlehoover called ["The secret ingredient: How to understand and resolve just about any flaky test"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3-v54jrQo).  If you want more of this hot content, go watch that.
2. There's some more details on [`minitest-bisect`](https://github.com/minitest/minitest-bisect)
3. And [Rspec has bisect too](https://rspec.info/features/3-13/rspec-core/command-line/bisect/). I put that in just for [Jon](https://jonrowe.co.uk).
