If you think of a test suite like a concert then each individual test is one of these people in the audience, enjoying their their night out.

Going to a concert is great, but ...

* someone might spill beer on you
* or they might talk throughout all the quiet songs
* or they might jump on your feet moshing to the fast songs,

That's not enjoyable.  That's ruining your night.  You're there to enjoy the music (the running of the test suite), but someone has spilled beer on you (created a flaky test).

That's not great.
