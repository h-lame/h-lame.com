...you _can_ try just thinking really hard and hoping that you solve it because you're looking at 2 test cases.

You've got one that's running before yours that is presumably the smoking gun here.  It did something that it didn't clear up and your one is like, "why is the world not how I cared about?  I'm failing!"

And so you _do_ have to think about it really hard.  But I've shared some ideas of what to look out for, and I've shared some tips to get to this point.

I think hopefully then you _can_ solve the flaky tests and feel bad about committing them in the first place.
