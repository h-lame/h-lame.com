So what are we going to cover?

1. We're going to talk about understanding.  Why do flaky tests happen in the first place?
2. We're going to talk about avoiding them.  How can we recognise where we might be putting a flaky test into place and what we can do to mitigate that before it even runs on CI.
3. And then last, we'll talk about how to resolve them.  Okay, CI has broken, and it's a flaky test. How do we resolve it?  How do we go from red, sad, flaky to green?

*[CI]: Continuous Integration
