Pretty much every method or function you’ve ever written is a sub-routine.  When you invoke them you start at the first line and run through them till they terminate and give you their result.

A co-routine is a little bit different.  When you invoke them they also start on the first line of code but they can halt execution and exit before they terminate.  Later you can then re-enter and resume execution from where you left off.

It’s also unlikely you’ll have written one, yet, as despite being around for a while not many languages provide them as a feature.
