On the other hand, in co-operative multitasking, the fiber itself has explicit control of when the CPU will transfer away.  This means it doesn’t need to lock anything because it’s safe in the knowledge that no other fiber will be running unless it says it’s done.

When the fiber is done (or happy that it’s done enough for now), it stops accessing the shared data and simply transfers control away to some other fiber.
