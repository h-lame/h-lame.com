The first non-ruby spec result on github that uses fibers was: [Neverblock](https://github.com/oldmoe/neverblock)<% footnote_reference 2 %>.

This library uses Fibers, [Event Machine](http://rubyeventmachine.com/) and other non-blocking APIs to present you with an API for doing asynchronous programming that looks remarkably synchronous.  So you don’t have to change your code to get the benefit of asynchronous performance.

I won’t go into details (I only have 1 more slide!), but you should check it out if you’re interested.
