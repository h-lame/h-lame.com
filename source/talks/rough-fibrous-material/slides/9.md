The main problem with pre-emptive multitasking is that (on a single core machine) these two threads are given CPU time arbitrarily by some scheduler.  They don’t know when in their life-cycle this’ll happen, so when thread alpha wants to access the shared data, it has to lock it.  Unfortunately this means the shared data could remain locked while thread beta has the CPU time, so thread beta can’t do anything.
