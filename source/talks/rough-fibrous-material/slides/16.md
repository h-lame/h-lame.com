This sort of lazy evalutation is where Fibers shine, and probably where they’ll see the most use.

And, in fact, it’s exactly this sort of thing that [Fibers are being used for in the ruby 1.9 stdlib](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Ruby_Programming/Reference/Objects/Enumerable).  Things like `.each` and `.map` have been reworked so that without a block they now return enumerators that you can chain together.  And under the hood these enumerators are implemented using fibers.
