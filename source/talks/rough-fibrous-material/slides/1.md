The key word in my title is “rough”; Iʼm coming to the material with little or no practical knowledge.  Iʼm not using 1.9 in my day job, and although I probably would use it for any spare-time hacking, itʼs very rare that I get down to any as I am, basically, lazy.

So apologies to anyone that knows this stuff already; I might get things wrong, or not cover everything in enough detail.  Iʼm sorry.
