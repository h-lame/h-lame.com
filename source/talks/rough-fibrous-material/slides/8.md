You should be familiar with pre-emptive multitasking as it’s the standard model of concurrency used by most Thread implementations.

You have several tasks running at the same time, scheduled by the OS or language runtime.  The gotcha is access to shared objects.

Fibers however use the co-operative model.  With this no tasks run at the exact same time and it’s up to the programmer to decide when each task will give up control and who to pass control onto.
