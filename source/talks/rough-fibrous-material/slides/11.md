I’ve bored you with the science part, how about looking at some code?

If you’ve used threads in ruby this should be familiar. You create a `Fiber` by passing a block to a constructor.  The block is the “work load” for that fiber.  In this case an infinite loop to generate increasingly excited hellos to the LRUG crowd.  Don’t worry about that pesky “infinite” though…
