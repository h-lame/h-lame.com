Hereâ€™s the fibrous way of doing it.  Again, there is a fundamental concept you need to understand first (co-routines), but I do think this is a slightly more natural way of defining the sequence.

The difference is that to get the 6th number, we have to call resume on the fiber 6 times.  With the side-effect of being provided with all the preceding 5 numbers in the sequence.
