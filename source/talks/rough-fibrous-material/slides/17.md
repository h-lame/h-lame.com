That’s all a bit theoretical.  What real use are fibers?

Well, I don’t know, so I did [a quick search on github](https://github.com/search?l=Ruby&q=fiber&type=Code), and to my surprise there were actually plenty of results.

But… on closer inspection, the first few pages are entirely forks and copies of the [Ruby specs for fibers](https://github.com/ruby/spec/tree/master/library/fiber).  Which, by the way, I totally recommend reading if you want to get an idea how something in ruby actually works.

The first result that wasn’t a ruby spec requires another detour first.
