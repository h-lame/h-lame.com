Last slide.  There’s loads I didn’t cover, but I think I got the basics.

There are 3 remaining API methods (apart from `resume` and `yield`) which I already covered.  `Fiber#transfer` is like `yield`, but instead of giving CPU back to the caller, you give it to the fiber you called `transfer` on.  The other two are simple enough.

Fibers are supremely lightweight: spinning up fibers takes much less memory than spinning up a thread.  There’s [a good comparison from the author of the Neverblock gem](http://oldmoe.blogspot.co.uk/2008/08/ruby-fibers-vs-ruby-threads.html).

The downside is that they are a single-core solution really, and weʼre increasingly heading towards a multi-core world.
