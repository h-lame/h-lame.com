Hereâ€™s a simple subroutine example.

When you call a method the flow of control enters the function, and is trapped until the method terminates.

Once the method terminates, here with an explicit `return`, but it could be an exception, or simply stopping after the last executable statement of the code path, the flow of control is finally released to the caller.
