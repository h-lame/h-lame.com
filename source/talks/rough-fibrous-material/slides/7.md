What makes co-routines even more interesting is that we can `yield` and `resume` as many times as we want, until, of course, the co-routine comes to a natural termination point.

We can also have as many `yield`’s as we want, we don’t always have to `yield` from the same place.  Although having `yield`ed at a given point, we `resume` at that point, we can’t choose some other `yield` point to re-enter at.
