And hereâ€™s a similar example for a co-routine.

It starts pretty much the same way. The flow of control enters the method and is trapped until it provides a result, this time with a `yield`.  However, unlike before, we can `resume` the method and send the flow of control back in to continue working, picking up where we were when we left off.
