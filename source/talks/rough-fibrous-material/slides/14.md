Hey, so what’s a talk without [Fibonacci](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number)?

Here’s the standard implementation for generating a number in the fibonacci sequence using ruby.  It uses recursion, which is something you have to get your head around before you see how it works, and that can be hard sometimes, and you have to take care to have correct guard clauses to make sure you terminate the recursion.
