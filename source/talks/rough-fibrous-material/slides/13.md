So although we gave `hello_lrug` a workload that **will never end**, it’s not a problem because we use the `yield` and `resume` methods to explicitly schedule when `hello_lrug` runs.  If we only want to run it 5 times and never come back to it, that’s ok, it won’t eat up CPU time.  This gives us an interesting new way to think about writing functions; if they don’t have to end lazy evaluation becomes super easy.
