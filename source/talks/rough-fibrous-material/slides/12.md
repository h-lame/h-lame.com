When you create a fiber, again just like a thread, it wonâ€™t do anything until you ask it to.  To start it you call the somewhat chicken-before-the-egg `resume` method.  This causes `hello_lrug` to run until it hits that `Fiber.yield`.  This pauses execution of the fiber and returns the value passed to it.  You also use `resume` to re-enter the fiber to do some more work.
