Once you exit a sub-routine, the door is closed; you can’t return to it the way you came out.

To re-use the sub-routine, your only option is to re-invoke it and go back to the first line of code.  This creates a new copy of the entire stack, so there’s nothing shared between this invocation and the previous ones, or any future ones.  Depending on your code, this could be expensive.
