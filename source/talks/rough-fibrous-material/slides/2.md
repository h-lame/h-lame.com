Fibers are an implementation of 2 important ideas:

1. The first idea is “co-routines” (and this should sound familiar, as you’ll have heard of sub-routines which are related)
1. The second idea is “co-operative multitasking” (and again, you should recognise this as similar sounding to “pre-emptive mutlitasking”).

Weʼll take a quick detour to cover these in turn and then weʼll come back to Ruby.
