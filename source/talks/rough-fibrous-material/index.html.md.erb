  <% footnote_definition 1 do %> To be fair to the evented code, the `open` method is a blunt abstraction that wraps up some gnarly `Net::HTTP` code thatʼs not much better than the evented code in the slide.  I guess I wanted to make Neverblock look like a better idea.<% end %>

  <% footnote_definition 2 do %> The slide suggests visiting [www.espace.com.eg/neverblock](http://www.espace.com.eg/neverblock/), but that page no longer exists. The github repo will have to do for now.<% end %>

I gave this talk at the [February 2010 meeting of the London Ruby User Group](http://lrug.org/meetings/2010/february/).

The slide format was 20x20; twenty slides that auto-transition after twenty seconds.  The transcript below comes from the presenter notes so represents a perfect version, which is unlikely to be exactly what I said on the night.
